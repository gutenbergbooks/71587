 ><small>A PROMISING JOB</small></h2>


<p class="noindent">“<span class="ellips">...</span> <span class="smc">Six</span>, seven, eight, nine, ten; there you are!”</p>

<p>“And there’s your bill back in exchange; <span lang="fr">Monsieur
Moche</span>, I thank you.”</p>

<p>“It’s <em>I</em> should thank <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>“Not at all, not at all<span class="ellips">!...</span> Your leave, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>,
to count them over again on my side? Ten thousand
francs, quite a sum of money!”</p>

<p>“My word, yes, my man; so that clears your budget, eh?”</p>

<p>“Please don’t think I mistrust you because I check the
notes; it’s the usual thing.”</p>

<p>“Go on, go on; don’t apologise.”</p>

<p>The bank collector deposited his peaked cap on a straw-bottomed
chair beside him, mopped his streaming brow, and
moistening his thumb with a rapid, eminently professional
movement, passed one by one between his fingers the ten
big blue bank notes his debtor had just paid over to him.</p>

<p>The heat was stifling; it was the 15th of May—settling
day, and about four o’clock of the afternoon.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Bernard</span>, an <span lang="fr">employé</span> at the <span lang="fr">Comptoir National</span>, was
nearly at the end of his day’s round when he reached <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> abode, which lay at the far end of the <i lang="fr">quartier</i>,
No. 125 <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>.</p>

<p>The man had climbed the stairs slowly. On the fourth
floor right was a door with a brass plate on which was
inscribed:</p>

<p class="thtbk ctr"><a id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><br class="ns"><i><span lang="fr">Moche</span>, Advocate</i></p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">The description was only roughly indicative of the professional
status of the tenant of the fourth floor. <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>
was indeed an advocate, but not an advocate borne on the
rolls of the <span lang="fr">Cour d’Appel</span>, a pleader affiliated to the Paris
bar and consequently bound by the strict rules of the
profession; he was an <em>advocate</em> in the bare, literal sense of
the word, leading persons of some perspicacity to surmise
that <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> was in actual fact merely an ordinary
business agent.</p>

<p>Nor was the impression produced on a visitor entering
<span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> domicile such as to modify the supposition.
A real barrister’s chambers are in the main very much like
any middle-class private house, whereas <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> office,
or to be more precise, <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> offices, bore the unmistakable
stamp of a place of business.</p>

<p>The first room you entered was divided in two by a
partition pierced by wicket-windows, the lower portion
being solid, the upper consisting of a lattice-work of stout
bars. Behind could be seen rows and rows of deed-boxes
and bundles of papers ranged on big shelves. In this room
<span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> generally sat, and whenever the outer door opened
he would follow suit by throwing open a little window and
popping out his head to take stock of the visitor.</p>

<p>Anyone who had ever seen <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, or even his head
only framed in the window opening, could never forget the
man, for the advocate of the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span> possessed
a physiognomy that was highly characteristic.</p>

<p>His features, prematurely wrinkled, betrayed his age to
be a good fifty. Following the fashion of ministerial officers
of former days, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> wore on his cheeks a pair of
short, bushy whiskers, of a reddish hue that made them
strongly resemble a rabbit’s paws. His rather prominent
nose, under which a black smudge of snuff was invariably
to be found, carried a pair of enormous, round, gold-rimmed
spectacles. Atop of his skull, which one guessed to be
completely bald, was perched a badly made, badly kept
wig, ragged at the temples and unduly flattened at the
crown, whereon the wearer found it necessary from time to
time to balance a little velvet skull-cap.</p>

<p><a id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Had it not been for the shifty eyes that were never at
rest for an instant, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> might have been taken for a
perfectly honest man; yet his old-maidish manner, his
soft, silky address, his often exaggerated politeness, his
trick of rubbing his hands and bending his back before
visitors, somehow modified any such favourable impression.</p>

<p>Still, as a matter of fact, despite his unpleasing exterior,
<span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> had earned an excellent reputation in the <i lang="fr">quartier</i>.
He was a serviceable, obliging old fellow, occasionally over
inquisitive about other folks’ business, but as a rule ready
enough to do a kindness. Many a one in the neighbourhood
had had recourse to him at one time or another for little
loans of money, granted, it is fair to say, at quite reasonable
rates of interest, and none had come to any harm at the
hands of the old man of business.</p>

<p>The truth is, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> was richer than people might
suppose, judging by the appearance of his abode on the
fourth floor, a quite modest set of apartments. Apart from
the outer room with the barred and windowed partition,
the accommodation included a second apartment, a trifle
larger, a trifle more pretentious, which was honoured with
the title of drawing room. One or two armchairs of worn
and faded leather and a round table with a gas chandelier
over it made up the furniture. The room had two windows
looking on the street, and affording a superb view over the
northern parts of the city and the fortifications running
parallel with the <span lang="fr">Boulevard Mortier</span>.</p>

<p>The third room of the flat was <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> bedroom, a
chamber rarely occupied, however, for its tenant frequently
slept from home, and appeared to utilize his quarters in the
<span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span> merely as a place for interviewing
callers and conducting his business affairs in general. <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, in fact, was entitled to use more than one address,
and it was matter of common knowledge that he was owner
of a house in the <span lang="fr">La Chapelle</span> district.</p>

<p><span class="ellips">...</span> The collector had finished his verification of the
total, and declared it to be correct. Then he added, as he
turned to take leave of <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>:</p>

<p>“There, my day’s work’s done, or as good as done; I’ve
only another flight to climb in your house, and then back
to the bank as fast as I can go, for I’m behind my time
already.”</p>

<p><a id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>At the words, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> looked at the man with an air
of surprise.</p>

<p>“You have a payment to collect on the floor above,” he
asked, “and from whom, pray?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Bernard</span> consulted a little memorandum book dangling
by a string from a button of his uniform.</p>

<p>“From a <span lang="fr">M. Paulet</span>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” laughed <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” affirmed the other; “<!-- TN: opening quote invisible --><span class="ellips">...</span> oh, a mere
trifle, a matter of 27 francs!”</p>

<p>“Well, good luck to you,” concluded the old man
philosophically, closing the wicket, as the bank <span lang="fr">employé</span>
took his leave with a bow and a final word of politeness:</p>

<p>“Hoping to meet you again, sir!”</p>

<p>Left alone—he kept neither housekeeper nor office-boy—the
old fellow stretched himself in one of the old leather-covered
armchairs in the dining room. Through the open
window came a breath of cool air. <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> sat in his
shirt sleeves, enjoying the evening freshness, and presently
took advantage of his momentary leisure to inhale a huge
pinch of snuff. Not a sound came from without—vehicles
are few and far between in the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>—and only
faint and far away in the distance could be caught the
occasional tinkle of the bells of the electric trams that, in
this remote quarter of Paris, link up the outer suburbs with
the central districts of the capital.</p>

<p>Suddenly, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> started violently; from the floor
above a dull, heavy thud reached his ear. He found no
difficulty in identifying the sound—it was that of some
heavy object falling on the floor above his head. The old
man scratched his chin and muttered half aloud:</p>

<p>“It’s a piece of furniture <span class="prellips">overset </span><span class="ellips">...</span> or a body!”</p>

<p>For a minute or two he stood hesitating, but <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>
was a man of a curious and inquiring turn of mind.</p>

<p>Abandoning the siesta he was proposing to enjoy, he
crept cautiously from the salon, and crossed the outer room
of the flat, which opened directly on the landing; then,
stepping noiselessly in his felt slippers, he climbed the stairs
leading to the upper floor without a sound.</p>

<p>On the fifth floor of No. 125 <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>, there
had been residing for some weeks, in a pretty enough,
<a id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>albeit cheap, set of rooms, two individuals who appeared
at first blush to be just an amiable pair of turtle-doves.</p>

<p>They were quite young; the united ages of the two
would barely have equalled that of <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>! The man
looked twenty-three at most; his companion, a dainty,
slim little person, a brunette with great dark eyes, had
seen some sixteen summers at the outside.</p>

<p>They were lover and mistress, their names, his <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>,
hers <span lang="fr">Nini</span>. The pair had set up house together in the <span lang="fr">Rue
Saint-Fargeau</span> after their union one Easter eve in the
tenderest, but unconsecrated bonds of love. The two had
known each other from childhood. <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> was the son of
a worthy woman who kept the porter’s lodge at a big house
in the <span lang="fr">Rue de la Goutte-d’Or</span>. <span lang="fr">Nini</span> lived in the same
house, whither she had come as quite a child with her
mother, a respectable working woman, <span lang="fr">Mme. Guinon</span> by
name, widow of an <span lang="fr">employé</span> on the railway.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Nini</span> was the youngest of a large family; they had been
five brothers and sisters, but two having died at an early
age, <span lang="fr">Mme. Guinon</span> had only three surviving children. The
two elder, <span lang="fr">Firmaine</span> and <span lang="fr">Alfred</span>, were in regular employment,
the former at a mantua-maker’s in the <span lang="fr">Rue de la Paix</span>, the
latter with a bookbinder in the <span lang="fr">Rue des Grands-Augustins</span>;
but <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, a child of an uncontrolled and capricious temper
and a venturesome and vicious disposition, could never
acquire the habit of regular work, no matter how light.
Instead of going apprentice, the girl had preferred to run
the streets in company with the most outrageous young
scamps, boys and girls, of the <i lang="fr">quartier</i>.</p>

<p>This was the very thing to attract and fascinate <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>,
the concierge’s son, who, too, as the phrase goes, had a
wild “bee in his bonnet,” and who from his teens upwards
had been over and over again told by the flash girls of <span lang="fr">La
Chapelle</span> that he was far too pretty a lad ever to do any
work.</p>

<p>For all that, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> was scarcely to be styled an Adonis;
slenderly built and under the middle height, he had into
the bargain a pasty complexion, colourless hair and a pair
of pale, watery eyes. Still, the features were well cut,
almost refined. It was a common saying in the <span lang="fr">Rue de la
Goutte-d’Or</span> that for sure his mother must have gone
<a id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wrong one day with a man of quality to have brought such
a piece of goods into the world.</p>

<p>In a word, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> was the women’s darling, because not
only had the lad pretty manners of his own, but an inexhaustible
fund of high spirits and an amazing gift of the
gab—a typical “ladies’ man” in all the abomination of
the <span class="prellips">term </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and in all its beauty!</p>

<p>The whole <span lang="fr">La Chapelle</span> quarter was stirred to its depths
when <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> seduced little <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, and had there
and then resolved to set up house with the girl. There
had been some violent scenes with the child’s family;
<span lang="fr">Mme. Guinon</span>, in particular, had been profoundly grieved
at the catastrophe. But there, one must learn to take
things as they come—and she had resigned herself to the
inevitable.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, for the two months the pair had been
living together as man and wife, the lovers appeared to have
grown quite well behaved. <span lang="fr">Nini</span> kept her little home in
decent order, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> worked now and then at his trade of
stone-mason, which he had learnt once upon a time in a
mighty haphazard fashion. Such at any rate was the
official, ostensible occupation of the tenant of the fifth floor.
But his real business, one which sometimes of evenings he
constrained his pretty mistress to follow, was, may we
surmise, of a less reputable sort.</p>

<p>An angle in the line of house-front enabled anyone looking
out from the staircase window to see what was going on
in the kitchen of the flat occupied by this dubious couple.
At the moment <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> reached this window, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> and
<span lang="fr">Nini</span> were engaged in a highly animated conversation;
and, be sure, the old man looked on and listened with all
his eyes and ears.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> was lost in astonishment at the strange attitude
of the two and the amazing things they were saying! Bending
down over the sink, <span lang="fr">Nini</span> and <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> were letting the
water pour over each other’s hands, which they were soaping
in feverish haste, while red soapsuds dripped between their
fingers into the trough.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span> was saying:</p>

<p>“Buck up, <span lang="fr">Nini</span>! Don’t let the flies grow on <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
once the stuff dries on our fingers, there’d be the devil’s
own job to get it off afterwards!”</p>

<p><a id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I know that,” muttered <span lang="fr">Nini</span> in a trembling voice.
Then she added:</p>

<p>“But, look, I’ve got some on my apron, too.”</p>

<p>“Lather it well,” her lover told her, “and if it <em>won’t</em>
come off, we’ll chuck the thing in the fire.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span> half turned round and reached down from a shelf
a heavy hammer stained with blood, which he set to work
to sponge carefully.</p>

<p>“That’s mighty dangerous, too,” he observed, “if it’s not
wiped clean.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> could form a pretty shrewd notion of what
had occurred before he arrived. Mechanically he mounted
the three or four steps that still separated him from the
landing of the floor occupied by <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> and <span lang="fr">Nini</span>.</p>

<p>The door stood ajar—a crazy piece of imprudence! <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> pushed it open softly and made his way stealthily
along the little passage at the end of which was the kitchen.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the half dark, his foot struck against something.
<span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, his sight getting accustomed to the
dim light, gazed down at this “something” with haggard
eyes—it was the body of a man lying quite still, face downwards
on the floor!—the body of the bank collector!
At the back of the neck showed a fearful wound.</p>

<p>The thing was beyond a doubt—<span lang="fr">Paulet</span> had murdered
the <span lang="fr">employé</span> from the <span lang="fr">Comptoir National</span>.</p>

<p>The unfortunate man’s wallet lay beside him, wide open,
and <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> could see that its contents had not yet been
touched. The bank notes stuck half out of the case, like
the contents of a parcel that has been ripped up; you had
only to stoop to help yourself. It was plain <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> and
<span lang="fr">Nini</span>, their victim once dead, had merely shut to the door,
without making sure it was fastened, calm and confident
in their conviction that nobody in the house, empty at
this hour of the day, would come in to surprise them.</p>

<p>The deed once done, they had deemed the most urgent
thing was to set to work instantly to cleanse their hands
and clothes in order to get rid of the evidences of their
guilt at the earliest possible moment. The corpse lay
absolutely motionless. Not a doubt the bank <span lang="fr">employé</span>
had been killed outright with one blow.</p>

<p>During the few seconds <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> stood hesitating before
the ghastly sight, he could still hear the two accomplices
<a id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>minutely discussing the details of their cleansing operations.
But there was something else that, even more than his
curiosity to overhear what they were saying, held the old
advocate’s attention—to wit, the bank notes that overflowed
the wallet, that were all but out of their receptacle,
that seemed to be actually offering themselves to whosoever
cared to appropriate them.</p>

<p>It was a strong temptation—and <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> did not
resist it!</p>

<p>Creeping like a cat, hiding in the semi-darkness of the
little passage, with a thousand precautions, he advanced
step by step; he reached out his hairy hand, his fingers
shook as they touched the brass fittings of the open wallet;
then his hand fell on the bundle of notes. Suddenly he
sprang back in alarm—<span lang="fr">Paulet</span> and <span lang="fr">Nini</span> had stopped talking.
Had they heard him?</p>

<p>But presently the same excited conversation began again.
Whereupon <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, with an ugly smile on his face, crept
down again to his own floor, bolted his door and counted
his spoils. Yes, it was a fine stroke of business; not only
did he recover his own ten thousand-franc notes, but with
them were ten others of the same denomination!</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Money well invested and that brings in cent.
per cent. on the nail, or I don’t know what I’m talking
about!” <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> muttered in delight, his eyes sparkling
with greed.</p>

<p>But next moment, the old man turned ghastly pale.
The front-door bell had rung! Instinctively, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>
crammed into his pocket the notes he had just stolen so
audaciously, and with the aplomb of a hardened thief.</p>

<p>Then he stood stock still, waiting. Would the visitor
insist? Yes, he would; the ring was repeated. <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>
had nothing to fear, for the moment at any rate; had he
not taken the precaution to double lock the door? Still,
he must find out what was afoot. In one second the old
fellow had plotted the whole plan of the line of behaviour
he must adopt.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul,” he thought to himself, “it can only
be a caller, a client, and there is no reason why I shouldn’t
receive him; if by any chance it were <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, I need only
refuse to open and leave him to kick his heels till the police
arrive.”</p>

<p><a id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>At the third repetition of the summons, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> put
the tentative question:</p>

<p>“Who is it? What do you want?”</p>

<p>Through the door the old advocate caught the sound of
a fresh young voice asking timidly:</p>

<p>“Is this <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <span class="prellips" lang="fr">madame </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>; but I don’t know if
he can be seen. What is it about?”</p>

<p>“A lady wishes to speak to him—about a flat to let in
the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Evangile</span>.”</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Rue de l’Evangile</i>, that was where <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> owned a
property. Most certainly it would never do to send away
this inquirer who appeared anxious to take rooms in his
house.</p>

<p>So <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> turned the key in the lock and half opened
the door to make sure his visitor was alone, and that no
one suspicious accompanied her. Evidently there was no
cause for alarm, and the old man stepped back and threw
the portal wide open.</p>

<p>“Pray come in, <span lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>,” he said with a bow, and
ushered her into the little salon.</p>

<p>His visitor was a young woman, quietly but elegantly
dressed. Twenty-four at the outside, she was a tall, fair,
pretty girl; a heavy veil partly masked the brilliance of her
complexion of lilies and roses; she wore mourning weeds.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span>, after a brief survey, pointed to a chair and
invited her to state her business.</p>

<p>“Sir,” began the unknown, “at present I am living in
the <span lang="fr">Rue des Couronnes</span>, but on account of my work—I am
employed in the correspondence office of a factory at
<span lang="fr">Aubervilliers</span>—I am anxious, very naturally, to make my
home nearer the place where I work. Well, I have been to
see a flat in your house in the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Evangile</span> that would
suit me, provided you would consent, as the concierge led
me to hope you would, to make a trifling alteration.”</p>

<p>The girl spoke simply, equally without exaggerated
timidity and undue assurance.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> looked at her with interest, preoccupied as he
was; still he forced himself to attend to the conversation.
Meantime, to gain time and recover his equanimity, he
asked:</p>

<p>“Whom have I the honour to address?”</p>

<p><a id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“True,” the young woman apologized, “I have not
told you my name yet; I am <span class="prellips">called </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>.”</p>

<p>The girl had pronounced the name only after a momentary
hesitation, a fact which did not escape <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span>
perspicacity. He said nothing, but cast a long, scrutinizing
glance at his visitor. He saw that she was colouring.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Mademoiselle Elisabeth Dollon</i>,” he repeated the name;
“now it’s a curious thing, but somehow the name strikes
me as not unfamiliar.”</p>

<p>The young woman had risen, and her brows contracted;
she seemed agitated and spoke with difficulty.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, sir; but I always feel strangely moved
whenever I have occasion to mention my name.”</p>

<p>“Why, pray?” demanded <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, courteously.</p>

<p>“Why? Oh, sir! some years ago my name acquired a
sad notoriety through the tragic, the lamentable deaths
of the dearest of my family. First, my father was murdered
under mysterious circumstances in a railway carriage;
then it was my brother who disappeared, struck down by
an odious criminal, who furthermore caused him to be
accused, even after his death, of the commission of atrocious
crimes.”</p>

<p>These statements, succinct as they were, sufficed to
reanimate <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> recollection.</p>

<p>“I have it,” he cried, “yes, I <span class="prellips">know </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Dollon </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
the <span lang="fr">Dollon</span> <span class="prellips">case </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Jacques Dollon </span><span class="ellips">...</span> so he was your
brother? <span lang="fr">Jacques Dollon</span>, whom they called the ‘Messenger
of Evil.’”</p>

<p>The girl, greatly agitated by this reminder of a terrible
past, merely nodded her head affirmatively, while great
tears filled her eyes.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> expressed his sympathy: “I am truly sorry,
<span lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>,” he said, “to have recalled such mournful
memories to your mind; but as landlord of the house where
you wish to take rooms, I was bound to know your name;
but I assure you that from <span class="prellips">henceforth </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>He broke off, but presently resumed:</p>

<p>“You spoke just now of a small alteration in the flat
you wish to rent.” He had guessed from the first what
it was and was quite ready to agree.</p>

<p>“You think, <span lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>, that the five rooms of the
vacant flat are really more than you require, and you are
<a id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>asking me, I feel convinced of it, to divide the premises in
two by having a party-wall constructed?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> assented: “That, sir, is what the concierge
led me to expect.”</p>

<p>“Consider the matter settled,” declared <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>; “and
accordingly, the premises being only one half as big, the
rent will be proportionately less—I will ask you 400
francs. When do you wish to move in?”</p>

<p>“As soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“The rooms are empty; as soon as ever the partition is
built, you can take possession.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> went into the adjoining room and returned with
a form of contract he had taken from one of the pigeonholes.</p>

<p>“Sign this paper, <span lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>, if you please.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> was preparing to do so when he asked
another question in a tone of fatherly interest: “You are
alone, eh? quite alone?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” replied the girl, whose look of surprise
clearly showed that she failed to understand what her
prospective landlord would be at.</p>

<p>The latter explained: “The house in the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Evangile</span>
is let out to very desirable tenants—only respectable
families<span class="ellips">....</span> It is not for me to judge your character,
my dear young lady, but if you did happen to have a
‘friend,’ or several ‘friends,’ why, you must not let them
come to see you—or not too often, at any rate.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Mademoiselle Dollon</span> drew herself up.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she declared, a good deal offended, “I don’t
know what you take me for, but I am an honest <span class="nw">woman—”</span></p>

<p>“Well, well, I felt sure of it the moment I set eyes on
you; but there, it’s as well to understand one another from
the <span class="prellips">beginning </span><span class="ellips">...</span> So please sign your name there, <span lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>”—and
with his great hairy finger, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> pointed
out the place.</p>

<p>This formality completed, she bade a hasty farewell to
<span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, who escorted her politely to the door.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">“Brigand, scoundrel, blackguard, thief!”—a torrent of
insults, followed by a torrent of <span class="prellips">blows </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> was
on the point of recrossing his threshold when he was struck
full in the face and felled to the ground. As he lay there,
<a id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he felt the weight of a man’s body crushing him, holding
him forcibly down.</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, for all his years, was a wonderfully active
man, and quite unexpectedly nimble. In one second he
had shaken off the incubus and leapt to the other end of the
room, where he stood glaring at his assailant.</p>

<p>It was <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> he saw, but <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> changed beyond recognition—eyes
starting out of his head, mouth set hard,
features convulsed, muscles taut.</p>

<p>The lover of <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, knife in hand, was for hurling
himself at <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, when suddenly he stopped dead. The
sharp click of a cocked pistol had struck him motionless
where he stood.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span>, quick as lightning, had not only dodged the
villain’s furious onslaught, but had whipped a revolver from
his pocket and pointed the weapon straight at the scoundrel’s
breast—</p>

<p>“Not another step,” he vociferated, “or I shoot you like
a dog!”</p>

<p>At the same moment a cry of anguish rang out. Behind
<span lang="fr">Paulet</span> appeared the face of <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, pale and agonized;
her two hands clutched her lover, whom she was holding
back with all her strength.</p>

<p>But the man had realized the risk involved in a fresh
attack, and was ready to parley. The voice shook that
came from between his clenched teeth: “Brigand!” he
repeated, looking furiously at <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, “brigand, give me
back my money!”</p>

<p>For a moment the old advocate entertained the idea of
shamming ignorance, pretending not to know what the
murderer meant by the demand. But a half-dozen words
that fell from <span lang="fr">Nini’s</span> lips decided him. “I saw you fumbling
in the money-bag,” she declared, and he knew at once that
dissimulation was useless. The wisest policy was to take
the bull by the horns there and then—and he had his plan
all ready, cut and dried. Best to play the game cards
face upwards on the table.</p>

<p>“No,” he declared, grimly, “I will not give you back
the money.”</p>

<p>“Ruffian!”</p>

<p>“One minut<span class="ellipsp">e...!</span>”</p>

<p>A sardonic smile curled the old man’s lips; he cast a
<a id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>searching glance at <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, questioning with which of his
adversaries he should open the attack. They were two to
one—was it not judicious to win one of them over to his
side so as to reverse the superiority of numbers?</p>

<p>“Poor little <span lang="fr">Nini</span>,” <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> murmured in softened,
honeyed tones, “my poor little girl, you’re in a nasty hole;
what ever is to become of you?”</p>

<p>The girl looked superciliously at the old man: “I don’t
understand,” she told him.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! you do,” returned the advocate; “nothing
easier to understand, my dear child; you’ll be left all alone
in life now, it is only a question of days, perhaps of hours—your
lover will be arrested by the police and in six
months from now guillotined at the back of the prison of
<span lang="fr">La Santé</span>. To do a man in to steal his money is always a
bad business!”</p>

<p>Beside himself with rage, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> screamed:</p>

<p>“But it was <em>you</em> who stole the money, <em>you</em> will be turned
off, too.”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, in the same quiet voice, yet all the while
keeping his revolver levelled at the scoundrel’s breast,
retorted:</p>

<p>“Impossible! How prove it? Bank notes can be made
to disappear; there’s nothing more like a thousand-franc
note than another thousand-franc note, while the dead body
of a bank messenger, a body stretched on the floor of a
lodging, fifth floor No. 125 <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>, the residence
of one <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> by name, that’s a thing it’s not so
easy to stuff away in a <span class="prellips">pocket-book </span><span class="ellips">...</span> Now, what are
you proposing to do with the corpse in question, eh, my
young friend?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span> turned ghastly pale. Since he had done the deed,
and especially since he had discovered there was nothing
to be gained by it, the money having vanished, the scoundrelly
apache had completely lost his head. If only things
had gone according to plan, the affair might well have
been highly advantageous. <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> had arranged it all with
<span lang="fr">Nini</span>—to kill the collector, to appropriate his takings and
fly right away to foreign parts. It was good business, a
job well worth the trouble. But, lo and behold! the
unlucky and unexpected interference of old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> upset
all their plans, for the old ruffian had left in the wallet
<a id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>nothing but a few small notes—just enough and no more,
to pay for a little spree.</p>

<p>It was <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, not a doubt of it, who had stolen the
<span class="prellips">money </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> was to pull the chestnuts out of the fire
and the other was to reap the <span class="prellips">benefit </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, in fact, had
actually seen the man making off! If at that very moment
the old man had not had a visitor, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> would have hurried
down at once and had it out with him there and then.</p>

<p>In broken phrases and a breathless voice, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> detailed
all this to the old advocate, who only smiled enigmatically.
After a pause, the latter spoke again:</p>

<p>“You are a fine, brave fellow, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>—a bit of a scamp,
too, but who can blame you? It’s just your little way, you
know<span class="ellips">....</span> Now, my man, I’m going to make an offer;
put your knife back in your pocket, I will clap my revolver
in its case—we shall be more comfortable so for talking;
let’s sit down one on either end of the table, and perhaps
we can come to some arrangement.”</p>

<p>The young brigand was at a loss, as he gazed alternately
at the old lawyer with the sharp eyes and at <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, who was
prompting him in hurried, urgent tones:</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>; do what the old ape says.
He’s an artful, knowing beggar, certain sure he’ll find the
trick to get us out of the hole we’re in<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> had caught what <span lang="fr">Nini</span> said. He stepped up boldly
to <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, with outstretched hands, though the young man
had not yet pocketed his weapon:</p>

<p>“There, you see, I trust you,” he declared. “I offer you
my hand, mate, as a good comrade—shake, my man, we’ll
fix up things yet.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span> gave in. Ten minutes later, seated at the round
table in <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> dining room, the advocate and his two
visitors, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> and <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, were just finishing a bottle of
wine together.</p>

<p>They clinked glasses for the last time:</p>

<p>“Well, then,” demanded <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, “it’s a sure thing, <span lang="fr">Moche</span>,
old man, you’re going to help me?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span>, with a superb and impressive gesture, laid his
heavy, hairy hand on <span lang="fr">Nini’s</span> touzled curls, where she sat
beside him:</p>

<p>“I swear it, on your lady-love’s glorious tresses, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>,
and that’s as binding as the Blessed Sacrament!”</p>

<p><a id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“All the same,” <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> warned his mistress with an air
at once peremptory and timid, “you’ll have to shut your
jaw tight and not go gassing about the job in hand.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Nini</span> nodded, laid a finger on her lip, and with a shrug
and a look of scorn:</p>

<p>“D’you really suppose,” she scoffed, “I should be such
a silly goose as all that?”</p>

<p>She said no more, for the two men were deep in confabulation.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> was asseverating:</p>

<p>“I tell you this, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, we’re in for a gorgeous fine thing;
don’t you imagine I’ve come to my present respectable
and respected age without seeing a thing or two and learning
pretty thoroughly what’s what in this world of ours! A
smart customer like you, with a smart chap like me to
help him, why, we’ll play some fine games together!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span> agreed, smiling a well satisfied smile. But one
detail still troubled him:</p>

<p>“The body,” he asked, “the fellow’s <span class="prellips">body </span><span class="ellips">...</span> upstairs;
what’s to be done with it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Never you worry, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, there’s more tricks than one
in papa <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span> pack, trust him for that. If you do what
I tell you, the ‘cold meat’ upstairs in your passage will
be fixed up, never fear, so he’ll never come back again:
it’ll take a mighty clever devil to find him, I can tell you!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand,” objected <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>.</p>

<p>“What’s that matter?” snapped the other.</p>

<p>The old scamp got up, stuffed his hands in his pockets—an
ordinary enough gesture seemingly, but in reality to
make sure his revolver was still safe in the inside-pocket
of his breeches.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span> had risen, and he, too, thrust his hands in his
pockets, in one of which he mechanically felt for his knife,
which lay there open. All very well to have made peace,
to have concluded a treaty of alliance over a bottle of wine—prudence
is a virtue all the same!</p>

<p>But neither <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> nor <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> had any warlike intentions;
the two malefactors had made up their minds it
was to their mutual advantage to help one another.</p>

<p>“As a fact, you are a mason by trade, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“H’m, that depends <span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><a id="png.022" href="#png.022"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Could you undertake to build a wall, a stone wall, a
brick wall, a lath and plaster partition, any guess contraption
of the sort?”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, yes,” laughed <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, “provided you give
me the needful supply of stone or brick or plaster and
lime for the job.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> clapped his arm on <span lang="fr">Paulet’s</span> shoulder:</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, that settles it; there’s not a minute to
lose, I engage from to-night.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, who had been waiting the result of the
colloquy with no small anxiety, <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, whose gaze fixed
first on one, then on the other of the speakers, tender and
passionate on <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, questioning and admiring on <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, and who had kept her curiosity forcibly in check
for all this time, could no longer restrain the question:</p>

<p>“But what are you going to do?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> looked first at her, then at <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>:</p>

<p>“You’ll see what we’re going to do all in good time,” he
announced, “but I can tell you one thing—what we’re going
to do is a mighty promising job.”</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER II<br
 ><small>A NIGHT AFFRAY</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">The</span> <span lang="fr">Boulevard de Belleville</span> at nine o’clock at night presents
a grim and forbidding aspect. Long rows of flickering
gaslamps cast wan reflections over the far-stretching
pavements, on which sinister figures—drunken men, dejected-looking
street-walkers and apaches—show momentarily
in the ruddy glow from the lighted window of dram-shops
of the sort <span lang="fr">Belleville</span> used to build or American bars
of a later fashion.</p>

<p>Along the sidewalk, with slow steps and head bent in deep
thought, moved a young man of twenty-five or so, with a
fine, intelligent face, but so preoccupied an air he scarce
seemed to know where his feet were carrying him. The
man was talking to himself; anyone overhearing his monologue,
or reading, if that could be, the thoughts that
surged within, would have been amazed, perhaps terrified.</p>

<p>“An odd thing, life! an odd thing and a repulsive!” he
was muttering. “Six months ago, seven months at most—God
knows how I have lived meantime—I was a King,
I was greeted with a string of pompous titles; gold jingled
in my <span class="prellips">pockets </span><span class="ellips">...</span> Six months ago I was on the path
to glory, the highest glory I could conceive of; was
on the road, with my old friend <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, after saving the
Sovereign of <span lang="de">Hesse-Weimar</span>, to share the honour of <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span>
arrest! in a word, I was in the full tide of success.
Then the luck changed, that devil <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> eluded us—more
than that, he contrived that <span lang="fr">Juve</span> was nabbed in
place of himself. <span lang="fr">Juve</span> in prison, I am myself liable to
arrest as an accomplice, forced to fly, to take to hiding.
The good days are over and done for me. I, ex-King of
<span lang="de">Hesse-Weimar</span> as I am, find myself, this eighteenth day of
May, starving, without a penny-piece in my pocket, and in
imminent danger of being <span class="prellips">gaoled </span><span class="ellips">...</span> oh, instability of
human fortune!”</p>

<p>The young man was <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>. The excellent
<a id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>journalist’s history to date was summed up in the few
words his despair had just wrung from his lips. By
<span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> arrest under the guise of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, and that thanks
to the deep duplicity of the Grand Duchess Alexandra,
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> had been plunged into the most alarming
embarrassments.</p>

<p>That <span lang="fr">Juve</span> was really <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had not, of
course, for one moment admitted. To him the thing was a
sheer impossibility, a supposition not only inconceivable,
but positively insane. But alas! the conviction he held as
to his friend’s innocence, and even the hope he entertained
that <span lang="fr">Juve</span> would soon succeed in exposing the monstrous
error whereof he was the victim, did little or nothing
towards bettering <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> personal predicament.</p>

<p>On leaving the <span lang="fr">Gare du Nord</span>, as they were carrying off
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> to prison, the young man had clearly realized that he
must disappear unless he wished to be clapped in gaol,
too. Now it would never do for him to be arrested, in the
first place because, if still at liberty, he could perhaps help
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> to get out of the mess, secondly, because now <span lang="fr">Juve</span>
was under lock and key, he, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, was the only one left
to fight <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> and paralyse the machinations of the
brigand whom he still held to be at liberty, inasmuch as
he refused to believe <span lang="fr">Juve</span> to be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.</p>

<p>At the time the journalist had some money in his possession.
Without a moment’s delay he had changed his
costume, and dressed out as a “ragged rascal,” had plunged
into the underworld, the social stratum where an artful
and wary fugitive can most easily cover up his tracks.
This done, he had waited events. Day followed day,
however, without bringing him any further information.
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> was in prison, the authorities still believing him to
be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, and this evening <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, who had hitherto
been living by casual odd jobs, was penniless and starving;
what was he to do, he asked himself.</p>

<p>The young man continued to follow the <span lang="fr">Boulevard de
Belleville</span>, hesitating between the notion of going to find
a night’s lodging under the arch of a bridge and his fear
of being run in by a police-patrol, an eventuality he was
far from desiring, when his attention was attracted to a
passer-by, a woman who brushed past him, walking very
fast, and rapidly outdistanced him.</p>

<p><a id="png.025" href="#png.025"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Hello!” muttered <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, looking after the form of
the young woman, “doubtless a Paris workgirl; now, if
I were really what I seem, an apache, I should profit by the
opportunity. A little woman of this sort would be better
in bed at this time of night than out and about on the
<span lang="fr">Boulevard de Belleville</span>! and she carries a bag in her hand—how
imprudent! I’d wager twopence something will
happen to the girl.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> possessed something of that extraordinary
instinct to be found in some veteran detectives. He seemed
to have a presentiment of crime, to divine beforehand the
possibility of acts of violence; and being a man of courage,
he never failed to forestall and try to prevent the
mischief. Mechanically, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> followed the young
woman, keeping some distance behind, and as he went,
took stock of her appearance. Small black toque, black
jacket, a flowing veil, a slim umbrella, small shoes, a quite
simple frock.</p>

<p>“A workgirl, a respectable workgirl, on her way home
after doing a bit of <span class="prellips">overtime </span><span class="ellips">...</span> Good!—but, well, one
may be mistaken!”</p>

<p>The young woman <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> was following had
just been accosted by a street-walker, a little dark-haired
creature with a touzled head, outrageously powdered and
painted, clad in the typical spotted corsage of her class, the
swaying skirts, the apron with scarlet bib, its pockets
bulging, stuffed full of silk handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>“Hello! hello!” thought <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, “so here’s my workgirl
in very odd company!—oh! dear, oh! dear.”</p>

<p>Next moment the young fellow darted forward at a run.
From the shadow two men had just sprung out on the
women; seizing them roughly by the arms, they were
hustling and dragging them away.</p>

<p>The street-walker put her head down, fighting hard,
but without uttering a sound; the workwoman gave a
piercing shriek for help.</p>

<p>To fly to the rescue, to save the woman in this perilous
strait, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor’s</span> mind was made up in an instant.</p>

<p>Someone else came hurrying up behind him at the same
moment. A voice shouted:</p>

<p>“Have at ’em, mate!”</p>

<p>“A gallant working man,” thought <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, as he
<a id="png.026" href="#png.026"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>caught a glimpse of a young man running across the road
dressed in a blue jacket, the sort plumbers wear; “there’s
still honest folk left who won’t let women be molested.”</p>

<p>But the time for action was come; he was level by now
with the two women, who were still struggling, and cried in
a peremptory voice to the assailants:</p>

<p>“Let the women go!—or I strike.”</p>

<p>At this the two bullies, finding it was their turn to be
attacked, suddenly loosed hold of their victims and wheeling
round to face <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> and his companion, stood on the
defensive.</p>

<p>In an instant <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> realized the state of affairs;
one of the fellows was putting a hand in his pocket—his
purpose was manifest.</p>

<p>“By God!” yelled the young man, “none of your tricks
here!—or you’ll make me angry.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was wrestling savagely, locked in a close embrace
with the fellow who had first laid hands on the workgirl;
behind him he could hear the laboured breath and fierce
cries and oaths of the working man who had hurried to
the rescue, and knew that the same battle was raging between
him and the second ruffian.</p>

<p>A few seconds, and all was over.</p>

<p>At the very moment <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, with a masterly trip,
stretched his adversary on the ground, where he held him
down by main force, he heard the workman give an exultant
shout of victory:</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! I’ve got you, you hound!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> looked round.</p>

<p>“Bravo, mate!” he cried, “so you’ve downed your man,
too?”</p>

<p>A thick, hoarse, common, ignoble voice replied:</p>

<p>“Downed him, have <span class="prellips">I </span><span class="ellips">...</span> yes, by gosh! and what’s
more I’m busy fixing the bloke up workmanlike, I am!”</p>

<p>“<em>Workmanlike</em>, eh?”—and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> looked, and could
scarcely believe his eyes. In the calmest way possible,
but with surprising dexterity, the man he had taken for a
working man had whipped a coil of rope from his pocket
and tied up the victim of his prowess.</p>

<p>“And now for your man!” he cried, pointing to the
wretch <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> held captive under his knee, and who had
now ceased to offer the slightest resistance.</p>

<p><a id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Must truss him up, too—but I think we’d best not do
’em <span class="prellips">in </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“Well and good!” thought <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, “why, by Gad! this
beats cock-fighting; it’s just the finest scoop I’ve ever
been in!”</p>

<p>The other went on: “It’s the street officers, look’ee—the
swine! I just love it when I can spoil their little
game. And it’s all to the good for our gals, eh?”</p>

<p>“For sure it is,” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> agreed, and getting to his feet,
for his companion had by this time roped up his man, too,
and rolled him into the gutter, not without planting a
shrewd kick or two on his carcass<!-- TN: original reads "carcase" -->, the journalist proceeded
to scrutinize his companion.</p>

<p>He was not a working man at all! True, he wore a
plumber’s short blue jacket, but it only needed to note his
flat cap, his brown muffler, to say nothing of the broad red
sash round his waist, his velvet <span lang="fr">Zouave</span> breeches, his elegant,
down-at-heel shoes, the whole vicious cut of the
fellow, to guess his vile trade.</p>

<p>“A fancy-man!” thought <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, “it was a fancy-man,
a bully, was his <span class="prellips">ally! </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and the two we’ve just planted
on the sidewalk are purely and simply a couple of police
officers!”</p>

<p>But once more the other broke in on his reflections.</p>

<p>“’Pon my soul!” he burst out, drawing <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> away
with a friendly grip on his shoulder, “it’s a rum business,
this <span class="prellips">here! </span><span class="ellips">...</span> all the same let’s pad the hoof, mate, the
boulevard ain’t a healthy place for us just now, if more
cops should come up.”</p>

<p>So <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> and his companion raced down the street at
tip-top speed and dodged in and out of a maze of dark
<span class="prellips">alleys </span><span class="ellips">...</span> In five minutes the apache called a halt.</p>

<p>“Easy does it now,” he panted, “they’ll never nab us
here.”</p>

<p>And then, suddenly confidential: “You know, don’t
you, why my donna stopped the wench?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, without showing a trace of surprise, replied
emphatically in the negative.</p>

<p>“Why, look’ee, old chap, I’d told <span lang="fr">Nini—Nini</span> my doxy’s
called—I’d told her when I saw your girl go by, ‘Look,<!-- TN: quotes fixed -->
sure as my name’s <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, there goes a wench who is bound
to have a bit of money in her <span class="prellips">bag! </span><span class="ellips">...</span> you go and talk
<a id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to her, pitch her a tale, tell her you have a sick brat at
home, some jeremy diddler or other, eh? and entice
her down a dark street—and you and I’ll deal with the
baggage.’”<!-- TN: quotes fixed --></p>

<p>Spitting on the ground to give more weight to his words,
the apache <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>—for <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> it was—added: “I take my
oath I never dreamt she was a night-bird, I took her for a
workgirl by her duds.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was far from liking the state of affairs, as he
realized more and more clearly the nature of the mistake
made.</p>

<p>His companion, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, evidently the “bully” of the
street-walker <span lang="fr">Nini</span> who had accosted the young workwoman,
took him, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, for the latter’s protector, while
the two men, whom he had supposed to be apaches, were
just simply guardians of the peace wanting to arrest the
two <span class="prellips">women </span><span class="ellips">...</span></p>

<p>To tell truth, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> was half sorry he had rescued
the two unfortunates, but, for all his philosophy, he
was still more amazed to have involuntarily become the
antagonist of the officers of the law and the accomplice of
a <span lang="fr">Belleville</span> “ponce.”</p>

<p>“What’s dead certain,” <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> summed up the matter,
“it’s another evening wasted, old son; our two wenches
took their hook during the fight, and I’ll wager they’ll say
they’re too much knocked out of time to put in another
stroke of business to-night—above all as <span lang="fr">Nini’s</span> none too
fond of work at the best of times. And so, hang it all!
we’ll just go drink a glass and have a snack, eh?”</p>

<p>This last proposal was eminently agreeable to <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>;
it was six and thirty hours since he had broken his fast,
and a supper, be it in company of an apache or no, was so
much to the good.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” he put in, however, for he had no desire
for a quarrel with <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> after their liquor, “the fact is,
for the moment I’m stony<!-- TN: original reads "stoney" -->-broke, cleaned out, not a brass
farthing to my name.”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> was in a generous mood. “Right O!” he
cried, “I’ve got the dibs; it’s my turn this <span class="prellips">time </span><span class="ellips">...</span> to
Korn’s, is it?”</p>

<p>For a bite of bread the unhappy young man would have
gone anywhere whatsoever. “That’s the ticket,” he agreed,
<a id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at once, adding by way of acting up to his rôle: “Maybe,
we shall meet some of the boys there?”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">At the <cite lang="fr">Rendez-vous des Aminches</cite>, the famous tavern kept
by old man Korn, the two portals of which opened respectively
on the <span lang="fr">Boulevard de la Chapelle</span> and the <span lang="fr">Rue de la
Charbonnière</span>, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> did not at first notice any of the
“boys”—or rather he made a pretence of knowing nobody.</p>

<p>In the low-ceiled, smoky room, where seated in state, old
Korn, his shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows, his bald
head shining in the gaslight, was rinsing out glasses stained
with the lees of red wine in a basinful of greasy water,
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had recognized, with a surprise that bordered on
stupefaction, a whole gang of people whom he knew very
well. While <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> was pushing him along towards a little
table, where sat an extraordinary-looking individual, head
like a broken-down tipstaff surmounted by a well-worn
wig, nose decorated with an enormous pair of spectacles,
frowsy mutton-chop whiskers framing the face, whom the
apache greeted with a “Good-day, <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, old cock!”
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had been taking stock of the other customers.</p>

<p>Later on, when <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, after ordering a litre of “Red
Seal,” bread and cheese and Bologna sausage, was describing
the late encounter to old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> and his meeting with the
“new chum,” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> seized the opportunity to scrutinize
the group of persons gathered at the further end of the
boozing-ken.</p>

<p>So, the old gang was come together again? again the
same lot haunted <span lang="fr">Père Korn’s</span> tavern? <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was dumbfounded
to meet once more at the <cite lang="fr">Rendez-vous des Aminches</cite>
the very same ill-omened crowd of apaches that had over
and over again been mixed up in the crimes and wild adventures
of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>; he could only just contrive to play
up to his assumed character and pay decent attention to
what <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> was saying, who meantime was praising him
up to the skies to <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>.</p>

<p>“Certain sure,” <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> was asseverating, “<em>you’ll</em> pay
for drinks, <span class="prellips" lang="fr">M. Moche </span><span class="ellips">...</span> yes, yes, your Honour, never
say no<span class="ellips">!...</span> But look’ee here, that chap yonder—I don’t
so much as know his blessed name—well, there’d be something
to be made out of him, eh<span class="ellips">?...</span> There’s no flies on
that bloke, you bet. Why in two twos and a couple of
<a id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>shakes, crack! he’d downed his gentleman, let me tell you
that, sir. Two constables, sir, and we chucked ’em both
in the gutter. Cost me a bit of good rope, it did—but
there, I don’t care.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, sipping an extraordinary mixture of brandy
and absinthe, applauded <span lang="fr">Paulet’s</span> narrative, and then turning
to <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, asked:</p>

<p>“So, young sir, things going well with you, eh?” The
question roused <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> from a deep fit of abstraction.
The old fellow repeated his remark.</p>

<p>“H’m, no!” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> confessed, “by no manner of means<span class="ellips">!...</span>
cleaned out!”</p>

<p>“And you can write?”</p>

<p>With the utmost seriousness the journalist declared he
could—“and none so badly either,” he added, “I write
quite a good hand.”</p>

<p>For some seconds the old man sat lost in thought; then
he brought out his proposal: “Now, what would you say if
I asked you to come and work with me? I am a business
agent, yes, a business agent—in <em>every</em> kind of business,
you must understand<span class="ellips">....</span> In one word, if you care to
sleep to-night at my place, why, there’s a pile of papers in
the garret, where you’d be comfortable <span class="prellips">enough </span><span class="ellips">...</span> say,
does that suit your book, my lad?”</p>

<p>For the moment <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> hesitated. He asked himself
who and what was this dreadful person, and for what
shady work was he engaging him—on <span lang="fr">Paulet’s</span> recommendation,
<span lang="fr">Paulet</span> a common “bully,” and that after he had just
heard how he had been an active participator in an assault
on officers of the law.</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> gave him a nudge: “Go on,” urged the
young blackguard; “you’re cleaned out, ain’t you? so you
risk nothing, and you’ll rake in the rhino scratching paper
at the old put’s—he’s rolling in money, you ask any of
the blokes here.”</p>

<p>So it seemed old <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, who frequented Korn’s tavern,
knew all the crew that met there.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor’s</span> mind was made up. No matter what
adventures might befall him if he agreed to “work” for
<span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, he ought by no means to neglect the opportunity
thus offered for renewing his observation of the machinations
of this amiable confraternity.</p>

<p><a id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“<span lang="fr">M’sieur Moche</span>,” he gave his answer, purposely exaggerating
his vulgar trick of speech, “as you might say, sir,
your offer does me proud—and for that there sleeping in
your garret, I won’t say no; for all it’s May time, it’s none
too cosy, it ain’t, dossing under the stars.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, who wore an enormous great ring on his
finger hammered noisily on the zinc-topped table.</p>

<p>“Korn,” he commanded, “another go of the same all
round; it’s my treat, I’ve just enlisted a new clerk.”</p>

 ><small>SHADY SCHEMES</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Elbows</span> resting on the hand-rail of the bridge, a man stood
gazing down pensively at the flowing water.</p>

<p>It was <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>. The old man was even dirtier than
usual, his hat crammed down over his ears—a huge topper,
all dinted and dulled; his brow was wrinkled in deep and
serious thought. It was eleven in the forenoon when the
usurer of the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span> had taken up his position
on the foot-bridge thrown across the narrow sluice-gates
separating the basin of <span lang="fr">La Villette</span> from the <span lang="fr">Canal de
l’Ourcq</span> and connecting the two sections of the <span lang="fr">Rue de
Crimée</span>. Heedless of anything passing about him, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>
looked down at the current, in which the man’s common,
cunning features were reflected as in a mirror. But at the
same time he kept ever and anon casting furtive glances
towards the bottom of the street.</p>

<p>At last the old fellow shook off his lethargy. From the
far end of the <span lang="fr">Rue de Crimée</span> he had caught sight of a man
dressed in a long white blouse who was pushing before him
a wheel-barrow loaded up with a workman’s tools. The
barrow bumped up and down over the uneven pavement
as the man advanced slowly along the road, for the load
seemed a heavy one. Still, in course of time the modest
vehicle reached the bridge. The workman let go the
handles, mopped his brow—it was a blazing hot day—and
then, after a glance round, he saw <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> and stepped
up to him.</p>

<p>It was plain enough the two had met by appointment,
for they seemed in no way surprised at the <i lang="fr">rencontre</i>. The
pair began talking in low tones:</p>

<p>“You were waiting for me, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I was waiting for you, waiting without much
hoping you’d come; still I waited.”</p>

<p><a id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The workman mopped his forehead again, muttering in a
weary voice:</p>

<p>“I’ve had the devil’s own job of it this morning, I can
tell you!”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” observed <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, a note of ironical commiseration
in his voice. Then the old business man went
on: “It’s uncommon seldom, all the same, one sees you
sweating yourself; when a man has a ‘bee in his bonnet’
like <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>The workman laughed:</p>

<p>“Say a hiveful of ’em, <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, and you’ll be nearer
truth. God! I can’t deny it, hard work’s not my strong
point.”</p>

<p>But old <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, suddenly putting on an air of sternness
and anxiety, questioned:</p>

<p>“Tell me, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, how goes the work in question?”</p>

<p>The young apache, who for the nonce, bore the stamp
of the most respectable of working men, replied eagerly:</p>

<p>“The work’s done, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>. Oh! I give you my word
I’ve put in a desperate hard four hours over the job; I’ve
never in all my life done such a day’s work for the masters.
True,” added the pale-faced young loafer, “it was no
ordinary job I had on<span class="ellips">....</span> Just you <span class="prellips">think </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> interrupted him:</p>

<p>“That’s all right, that’s all right, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>; no need to go
gassing here about matters that concern only you and me.
You shall tell me the whole story by-and-by if things have
gone well. Come along and have a glass with me.”</p>

<p>“And my barrow?” queried <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>.</p>

<p>“Bah! leave it on the sidewalk; no fear anybody’ll
come and pinch it. And besides, if they did make off with
it, I guess you’d never care; for you strike me as the
very image of a workman out-of-work.”</p>

<p>A good quarter of an hour later the two men were coming
out of the dram-shop, looking at once well satisfied and
mysterious.</p>

<p>The barrow was still there. <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> buckled to again and
towed it slowly up the slope of the <span lang="fr">Rue de Crimée</span>, while
<span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, keeping to the sidewalk, stumped along in a
line with the working mason.</p>

<p>The two confederates, who forty-eight hours earlier had
come near slaughtering each other over the tragic murder
<a id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the bank messenger, presently reached the top of the
incline and stopped a moment to take breath behind the
<span lang="fr">Parc des Buttes-Chaumont</span> at the opening of the <span lang="fr">Rue Botzaris</span>.
The place was admirably chosen for people wishing
to talk without fear of eavesdroppers. The street was
empty and in the park even not a soul could be seen afoot.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, pointing to a bench set against the palisade
surrounding a piece of waste ground—the very same where
some months before a woman’s body had been found hacked
to pieces—was saying to his companion:</p>

<p>“Sit down there, my boy, we’ve got to talk.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span> was not sorry to rest a while, for his barrow was
heavy; he gladly obeyed, and the two men faced each other.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Paulet</span>,” began <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, “I told you the day before
yesterday we were going to make a mighty fine thing of
it, unless you proved a funk.”</p>

<p>The apache lifted his right hand as if to take an oath.
“Never,” he asseverated, “I’ve never had cold feet, and
you saw yourself how I downed the bank man with a crack
on the noddle; he was dead and done for quicker than it
takes to tell.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> smiled, and resumed:</p>

<p>“Very true, my lad, you know your job. But as you are
so clever, d’you think you could run a man in trying the
epileptic fake, eh?”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, “what’s that mean?”</p>

<p>“That means,” went on <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, “you’ve got to upset
your client, tie him up to rights, and pop him in a wheeler
before he has the time to say ‘knife’.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing so very formidable,” remarked <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>.</p>

<p>But the old man proceeded.</p>

<p>“That depends on the place where the thing’s done.
Don’t you go and suppose I’m proposing to do the job in
a far-away corner at night when there’s nobody by—that’d
be elementary. My dear fellow, the man we’re to
pack away—for you may be sure I’ve got an idea at the
back of my head—we’re out to do his business in broad
daylight, in the open street, in the middle of Paris!”</p>

<p>“That’s a bit more difficult—but not impossible,” <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>
declared.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>“For sure, you’ve got the guts, my lad, and I begin to
<a id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>think you’ll do finely for yourself yet. But just tell me
how you’d set about it?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, who in his braggart way had declared the problem
old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> set him as simple as A B C, seemed a trifle nonplussed.
He scratched his nose, fingered his chin and
growled out some unintelligible remarks, then finally admitted:</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the whole truth, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, I have the best
will in the world, but I shouldn’t know just how to tackle
it.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> had expected the avowal: “No matter for
that, my lad. Now listen carefully to what I’m going to
say, for the little scheme I’m talking about must be carried
through this very afternoon. Now look here—we’re going
to stage the fine old play of the <em>epileptic seizure</em>. Presently,
after feeding time, we shall come along, nicely dressed up
to look like honest <span lang="fr">bourgeois</span>, into the high-life streets, say
the grand boulevards or the <span lang="fr">Tuileries</span>—I can’t tell yet exactly
where. We must shadow the individual I shall point
out to you. We’ll both walk behind him without any
concealment, so that he’ll notice us and forget to pay attention
to two other crooks who’ll be stumping along before us.
At a given moment I’ll give a signal, and one of the two
in front will turn sharp round and come into collision
with our man, then beg his pardon civilly for his blunder.
That’s the time, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, for you—you’ll be behind, you
know—to play up. A neat trip, and you’ll roll your
gentleman in the mud. Then, like t’other chap, you must
pretend to beg pardon, and meantime, when the guy’s got
his head down and his heels in the air along of the sudden
tumble, you’ll shove a stopper in his mouth.”</p>

<p>“A stopper, say you? but I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to understand,” went on <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>,
and adding ocular demonstration to description, he drew
from his pocket for his accomplice’s inspection a sort of
small india-rubber ball the size of a walnut. <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> examined
the contrivance with interest.</p>

<p>The old man proceeded: “Soon as the client’s got this
chestnut in his chops, he won’t be able to say bo! to a
goose, for look’ee, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, it’s made of elastic rubber you
can swell out as you choose.” So saying, he pressed a
spring, while <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> stood gazing in wonder and admiration
<a id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at the extraordinary implement of torture—nothing
more nor less than an ordinary chokepear or elastic gag.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> continued his explanations: “You can fancy,
when he’s got that between his jaws, how the beggar will
kick and dance like a cat on hot bricks; but he won’t be
able to articulate one word, and to make the fake more
lifelike still, we’ll take care to soap the rubber ball a bit
beforehand. Coming in contact with the saliva, the soap
will lather, and I bet you a pint of red our friend, what with
his wild contortions and the froth all over his snout, will
look for all the world like a man in a fit. The cleverest
doctor would be deceived. It’ll only be left then to get
him packed into a cab, and as it so happens, the cab we
shall pop him into will belong to one of our <span class="prellips">pals </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
While I’m busy about him, you, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> must be telling
the crowd helping us to get him in—you may be sure the
crowd will help us—how grieved you are at the occurrence.
You must cry in a big voice: ‘Oh! my poor dear 
<span class="prellips">friend </span><span class="ellips">...</span> what a <span class="prellips">calamity </span><span class="ellips">...</span> such a nice fellow, <span class="prellips">too </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
to think he’s always having these <span class="prellips">attacks </span><span class="ellips">...</span> well, we’ll
soon get him home now’—and so on and so forth. You’d
never need worry, my boy; you may rest assured the
cutest won’t suspect a thing<span class="ellips">!...</span> I told you before, and
I say so again, I’ve a sort of notion in my head that’s
getting clearer and <span class="prellips">clearer </span><span class="ellips">...</span> We’re going to do great,
great things, never you fear!”</p>

 ><small>AN EPILEPTIC SEIZURE</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Towards</span> five o’clock that afternoon a busy-looking individual
was crossing the <span lang="fr">Tuileries</span> gardens at a rapid pace.
Without a moment’s hesitation, like a man accustomed to
follow the same route almost every day, he strode over the
<span lang="fr">Pont Solférino</span>, then turned to the left and hurried along
the <span lang="fr">Boulevard Saint-Germain</span>. It was a man of thirty-five,
on whose powerful features could be read the signs of manifold
cares and anxieties, quick-eyed, alert, evidently a
person of distinction, and one well known by sight to many
Parisians. Not a few passers-by turned round to look
after him, seeming to search their memories to find the
name that belonged to the face they saw. Others again,
better informed no doubt, gave a start of surprise, then
bowed respectfully.</p>

<p>The pedestrian paid scant heed to their salutations,
pressing on deeply absorbed in his own thoughts, and not
so much as casting a careless glance in her direction when
he happened to meet or overtake a young, pretty and well
dressed woman. Nevertheless, on arriving opposite the
Ministry of Public Works, he halted in his rapid progress
to shake cordially by the hand an old man, wearing a
decoration at his buttonhole, who, despite the difference of
age, saluted the younger man with a profound bow.</p>

<p>“Good-day, <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>” began the old
gentleman, for the individual so addressed was in fact no
less a person than the Minister of Justice, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Désiré
Ferrand</span>.</p>

<p>After thanking the latter warmly for an official appointment
lately received through his instrumentality, the elder
man, an Engineer-in-Chief, <span lang="fr">M. Vauquelin</span> by name, expressed
his surprise at meeting the Minister moving about
the streets alone.

 </span></span></a>But <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> made light of his objections:</p>

<p>“My dear sir, my temperament is too energetic, my
nature too exuberant, to endure a purely sedentary life.
I must be up and about and on the move for some hours
every day. Very often I go to see friends who live at the
farthest extremity of the <span lang="fr">Boulevard Raspail</span>, and one of
my greatest pleasures is to find my way there afoot whenever
my duties allow me the <span class="prellips">time </span><span class="ellips">...</span> yes, on foot and
quite alone,” added the Minister, “like any ordinary citizen.”</p>

<p>“Alone, quite alone?” protested the other; “however,
I take it that is only in a way of speaking, Monsieur le
Ministre, for I feel very sure the Prefecture of Police keeps
an eye on so exalted a functionary as yourself and that,
according to custom, officers of the Criminal Investigation
Department assure your personal safety.”</p>

<p>“By no means,” protested the Minister, “I am afraid of
nobody, and will have no one accompany me.”</p>

<p>The old engineer made no reply, but on taking leave of
<span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span>, he shook his head sceptically, pointing to
two men who appeared to be following the Minister, but
keeping at a respectful distance behind.</p>

<p>“And those two?” he queried.</p>

<p>Presently, as the Minister was proceeding on his way,
he took occasion to glance behind him and noticed that
the two individuals pointed out were actually following
the same road as himself and seemed to be dogging his
steps.</p>

<p>The two men were of totally different appearance. The
one, dressed in a long frock coat and an old silk hat, was
of a common, vulgar type. His companion was a young
man wearing a light, well-cut jacket, breeches and a cloth
cap. He looked like a cyclist and might have been twenty
at the outside.</p>

<p>Watching them more carefully, <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> felt convinced
they were deliberately shadowing him. This was
intolerable, and a few yards short of the intersection of the
<span lang="fr">Rue de Rennes</span>, the Minister came to a sudden halt and
challenged the pair:</p>

<p>“What do you want, gentlemen,” he demanded, “why
do you follow me?”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">M. le Ministre</span>,” replied the elder of the two, “we are
Inspectors from the Investigation Department; we are
<a id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>instructed by the Prefect of Police to safeguard your
person.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> looked annoyed. “The Prefect,” he
said emphatically, “is over officious; I have no fears, all
I want is to be left alone in peace. Be so good as to leave
off following me; I will be responsible for the order I now
give you to your superiors.” The two bowed deferentially
and made a show of turning back the way they had come.</p>

<p>Meantime <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span>, cursing the Prefect’s precautions,
halted at the edge of the sidewalk, waiting for the
traffic to slow down and grow less dense before crossing the
<span lang="fr">Rue de Rennes</span>. He was just opposite the exit from the
North to South Underground as a numerous and compact
crowd of passengers issued from the bowels of the earth.
Taking advantage of the press, the two men whom the
Minister of Justice had ordered to turn back, but who had
only made a feint of doing so, approached their intended
victim, whom they had not lost sight of.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, rather staggered by the Minister’s rebuff, began
questioning <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, not without a note of anxiety in his
voice:</p>

<p>“I never thought,” he began, “we were going to meddle
with a toff of this swell <span class="prellips">sort </span><span class="ellips">...</span> such an important bloke
as all <span class="prellips">this </span><span class="ellips">...</span> a Minister’s not just like everybody else.”</p>

<p>“Silly boy,” replied the old fellow, “Ministers are made
of flesh and blood like the rest of us, and I can even assure
<span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> broke off suddenly, his face losing the look
of indifference it had worn hitherto.</p>

<p>“Attention!” he muttered, “the play’s beginning!”</p>

<p>A big man with huge hands and an evil face, standing a
few yards away, had just signalled to <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>; this done,
unintentionally it seemed, the fellow bumped violently
against <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span>, who staggered, taken unawares as
he was, and uttered a furious: “Look out, sir, look where
you’re going, I <span class="prellips">say </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>But at the same instant <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, in accordance with the
directions he had received, taking the Minister in the rear,
violently tripped up his heels. What old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> had foreseen
happened. The Minister pitched over backwards,
striking his head on the pavement and lay there half stunned.
Then <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, quick as lightning, dropped on his knees
<a id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>beside the fallen man and dragging the jaws open with his
sinewy hands, slipped the rubber ball into <span lang="fr">Désiré’s</span> mouth.</p>

<p>Instantly the chokepear dilated to thrice its size, and
try as he might, the unfortunate Minister could not ejaculate
one single word.</p>

<p>A crowd quickly collected. <span lang="fr">Moche</span> for his part had
prudently slipped away to one side, while his eyes searched
anxiously among the vehicles prowling round in search of
fares for a certain conveyance whereof the driver was his
confederate. Soon this particular cab hove in sight; indeed
it had never been very far from the scene of action. It
was a taxi that had been following the little group ever since
they left the <span lang="fr">Pont Solférino</span>.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span> meanwhile was playing his part splendidly. With
the help of the big fellow with the knotty hands who had
butted into the Minister in the first instance, he was
clearing a ring, pushing back the over curious.</p>

<p>“I beseech you, ladies and gentlemen,” he was shouting,
“go away; it’s a poor fellow, an invalid, who has just had
an attack. Yes, he’s in a <span class="prellips">fit </span><span class="ellips">...</span> he’s ill,” he kept repeating,
and everybody agreed the young man was perfectly
right.</p>

<p>The Minister in fact, utterly at sea as to what had befallen
him, merely aware that he could not utter a word and
that they would not let him get up, was writhing and
wriggling like a man possessed. A frothy lather covered his
cheeks and poured from between his lips.</p>

<p>The spectators were of one mind, all repeating parrot-wise
the same words:</p>

<p>“It’s a man been taken ill, an epileptic just had an
attack!”</p>

<p>The taxi selected by old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> drew up to the pavement.
With the help of kind-hearted assistants, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> and his
accomplice hoisted the Minister into the cab, still vainly
resisting!</p>

<p>The two brigands took their places inside with their
victim; then, just as the vehicle got under weigh, old
<span lang="fr">Moche</span> with surprising agility sprang on the step and took
his seat beside the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The plot had succeeded—a triumph, indeed!</p>

<p>But, after all, with what object had they kidnapped the
Minister of Justice? What did they expect to make of it?
<a id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>In the Chamber at the <span lang="fr">Palais-Bourbon</span>, excitement was
at its height. There was a constant coming and going of
Deputies, talking together eagerly without paying the
smallest attention to the demand for silence from the
President’s chair, whose bell rang out unceasingly. Presently,
however, quiet was restored when the President of
the Council, the much respected <span lang="fr">M. Monnier</span>, mounted the
tribune to make the following announcement:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I regretted a while ago to have to inform
you that our honourable colleague, <span lang="fr">M. Désiré Ferrand</span>,
Minister of Justice, had not returned to his <span class="prellips">house </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I
have this moment received an extraordinary letter, so
extraordinary in fact that I am tempted to believe it to
be the work of a practical joker. Nevertheless, under
present circumstances, I consider it my duty to make you
acquainted with its contents.”</p>

<p>“Read, read!” rose a unanimous cry—and in a voice
trembling with emotion, <span lang="fr">M. Monnier</span> read out:</p>

<div class="bq">
<p class="noindent">“—By my decree, <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> has been held
prisoner since yesterday. Again by my decree, he will
be released to-day at 5 o’clock.</p>

<p>“By seizing the Minister of Justice and holding him
at my disposition, I have merely desired to afford an
indication of my power to compel the House to negotiate
with me; I want money, I must have a million francs; let
the Government decide to give me this sum, and I will
disappear. If not, the direst consequences must be faced;
I shall begin with the Minister of Justice, the entire
Government will be dealt with in turn.”</p>
</div>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">The reading of this monstrous document roused in the
auditors divers feelings of the most opposite nature. While
some members laughed uproariously, persuaded it was
simply a grotesque joke, others looked perturbed, asking
themselves if the President of the Council had not lost his
head. But a vivid curiosity was universal. There could
be no doubt something prodigious, phenomenal was involved!
Supposing the defiance to be facetious, still the
disappearance of the Minister was alarming.</p>

<p>What was this mysterious power that functioned thus
in the dark, but whose existence could not be disputed?
Instinctively, reason, logic, common sense urged one and all
<a id="png.042" href="#png.042"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>to seek to know the author of these atrocious pleasantries,
and <span lang="fr">M. Monnier</span> was exhorted to make known the name
signed at the foot of the letter.</p>

<p>With a wave of the hand the President demanded silence,
then he announced, in troubled tones, not knowing whether
his words would provoke an outburst of mockery or of
panic:</p>

<p>“It is signed,” he said, “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>The Chamber was in an uproar. The name was too
familiar, too notorious, too terrifying, not to sow distraction
in the ranks of the people’s representatives. In truth
all were pretty well agreed that only <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> could have
had the audacity to imagine such a scheme could succeed.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!” they declared, “yes, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is at the
bottom of all this, that is certain, beyond dispute!”</p>

<p>But numerous objections were raised against any such
conclusion: “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, why yes, he exists, that cannot
be denied; but the police unearthed the fellow, the elusive
brigand was none other than the Criminal Investigation
Officer, Inspector <span lang="fr">Juve</span>! Now, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had been in gaol for
the last six months! He was to be tried; meantime the
prisoner was under safe watch and ward at the gaol of
<span lang="fr">La Santé</span>.”</p>

<p>At the same time, <span lang="fr">Juve-Fantômas</span> had accomplices no
doubt, and the head of the gang being under lock and key,
it was a justifiable supposition to allow that one of his
subordinates had taken over the direction of his nefarious
schemes. Already Deputies were busy suggesting names,
and that of <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> emerged conspicuous amongst
the divers conjectures tentatively advanced by Members.
All were unanimous in loudly and furiously proclaiming the
enormity of the scandal.</p>

<p>But suddenly a dead silence fell on the assembly. Five-o’clock
had just struck. Now everyone remembered the
terms of <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> letter, according to which the Minister
of Justice was at five o’clock precisely to be at the <span lang="fr">Palais-Bourbon</span>.
Anxiously the Deputies waited. Some minutes
passed amid tense <span class="prellips">excitement </span><span class="ellips">...</span> Then, suddenly, like a
clap of thunder, broke out a tornado of applause and
heartfelt congratulation, in which all parties joined unanimously.
Issuing from the corridor at the back of the hall
<span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> has appeared.</p>

<p><a id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The Minister’s powerful features wore a look of assumed
indifference, but for all the man’s command of his feelings,
it was plain he had passed through appalling experiences.
His face was drawn and pale, and the hair above the temples
seemed to have whitened!</p>

<p>A mighty rush surged towards the Ministerial bench,
each more eager than the other to express his cordial
sympathy and to hear what had happened to the unfortunate
Minister. The latter was explaining to those
about him as much as he had been able to understand
of the strange adventure, speaking hurriedly, in broken
sentences.</p>

<p>“The thing is inconceivable, insane, mad<span class="ellips">!...</span> An attack
in broad daylight, in the centre of Paris, in the
middle of a crowd of <span class="prellips">people </span><span class="ellips">...</span> Resistance was <span class="prellips">useless </span><span class="ellips">...</span><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->
I was forced into a motor cab! Once inside the
vehicle, brigands gagged me, blindfolded me, bound me
hand and foot. The taxi drove on and on a long, long
<span class="prellips">time </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I had no notion where they were taking me<span class="ellips">....</span>
I spent the night in a damp cellar, in cold and darkness,
while a masked man, holding me all the time under
threat of a revolver, tried to extort a promise of ransom
from me. He talked about a million <span class="prellips">francs </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I was
dumbfounded!”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!” was the general cry, “it is <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span>
work!”</p>

<p>The Minister went on: “This morning they brought me
food, I was dying of <span class="prellips">hunger </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I took what they
offered; then, about three o’clock, my gaoler of the previous
night, masked as before, returned after being away
for some minutes. He blindfolded me again, pinioned me
and once more led me to a waiting motor, which drove off
and only stopped at last after a long <span class="prellips">time </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I was told
to get out, and two men informed me I was now a free man,
while each set to work to unloose my <span class="prellips">bonds </span><span class="ellips">...</span> A few
minutes after, my hands being now free, I tore away the
bandage that covered my eyes and discovered I was in a
wood bordering a high road. The car which had conveyed
me was vanishing in the distance, carrying my captors
with it. I walked straight before me till I came to the
nearest house to be found, where I learnt I was on the
outskirts of the <span lang="fr">Bois de Viroflay</span>. An hour ago I was
<a id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>there <span class="prellips">still </span><span class="ellips">...</span> my first thought, gentlemen, was to come
to the <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Palais-Bourbon </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>The Deputies, after listening to this extraordinary narrative,
looked at one another in amazement as they exchanged
ideas in excited tones. Meantime <span lang="fr">M. Monnier</span> had drawn
his colleague on one side and was showing him the letter
bearing <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> signature.</p>

<p>“What is to be done?” asked the President of the
Council in much perplexity, a fine politician no doubt, but
lacking in decision in times of crisis.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span>, in no way unmanned by the tragic adventure
whereof he had been the hero, was boiling with
rage and indignation. Springing to the tribune:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he thundered, “the ludicrous outrage of
which you have been informed affects not simply and
solely a Member of the Cabinet, it affects the Government
itself, the Chamber as a whole, it is a blow aimed at the
entire Country, an insult you can never brook! more than
ever Paris lies terror-stricken at the crimes of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
and his accomplices. This is no time to mitigate stern
measures—far from it, we must show a hand of iron! As
Minister of Justice, I give you my guarantee that the most
peremptory orders shall be issued for the wretches guilty
of these acts of violence, the last of which was directed
specially at myself, to be energetically pursued and then
punished with the utmost rigour of the law. The danger
is not one to make us draw back, it should inspirit us to
go forward! The Government will ask your suffrages,
pledging itself to respect the claims of Right, of Justice
and of the Public Safety!”</p>

<p>A thunder of acclamation greeted the Minister’s bold
words, while from divers quarters came cries of:</p>

<p>“The names<span class="ellips">!...</span> the names of the malefactors<span class="ellips">!...</span>
<span lang="fr">Juve</span><span class="ellips">!...</span> <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span><span class="ellips">!...</span> The police—to work, the <span class="prellips">police </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span><span class="ellips">!...</span> down with the Press<span class="ellipsp">!...</span>”</p>

<p>Again and again cries were repeated and through the
ever swelling roar of this human flood, that tossed like a
tempestuous sea, pierced again and again the names of
<span lang="fr">Juve, Fantômas</span>, and above all of <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> is at large<span class="ellips">!...</span> <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> has disappeared<span class="ellips">!...</span>

<p>Standing like a statue in the tribune, arms crossed on
<a id="png.045" href="#png.045"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his breast, eyes aflame, as he looked down at his fellow-members,
<span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> signalled his assent and approval.
But his authority must win a sanction, his power be reinforced,
and as the Minister left the tribune, not without reiterating
his promise that the sternest and most peremptory
orders should be given the whole police force for the
arrest of the criminals, a member, leader of one of the most
important parties, laid on the table of the House the draft
of a motion; this was immediately read by the Clerk of
the Chamber, as follows:</p>

<p>“<i>The Chamber, justly indignant, but confidently relying
on the Government’s declaration of its resolve energetically
to pursue the criminal or criminals guilty of the unspeakable
outrage whereof the Minister of Justice has been the victim,
hereby offers the latter its sincere and heartfelt sympathy,
and proceeds to the order of the day.</i>”</p>

<p>The motion was received with unanimous shouts of
approval. By show of hands the Chamber voted the order
of the day, as proposed, and when, for custom’s sake, the
President demanded if any were of the contrary way of
thinking, not a hand was raised, not a protest was heard.</p>

<p>“By 527 votes in a house of 527 members present, the
order of the day is approved!” announced the President
triumphantly, as he vacated the chair.</p>

<p>“The first time in history,” declared the old hands of
the <span lang="fr">Palais-Bourbon</span>, “the Chamber has ever recorded a
unanimous vote!”</p>

<p>It was now seven o’clock in the evening, and as they
emerged on the Quai d’Orsay, greeted with acclamation
by the throng of idlers waiting outside, members jostled
against newsboys crying special editions of the evening
papers, wherein were already described in the minutest
detail the extraordinary events that had just taken place.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smc">So</span> your birth certificate is an unknown quantity, eh?
and there’s no means of knowing what your name properly
is?”</p>

<p>“What can that matter to you, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>?”</p>

<p>“Oh! for me, it’s nothing to me. I don’t care a hang;
you’re a tremendous cute chap, that’s all I want to know;
your patent of nobility you can leave with your ‘uncle,’
if that’s where you’ve deposited it, eh, my lad?”</p>

<p>“That’s where it is—or somewhere else, <span lang="fr">Monsieur
Moche</span>.”</p>

<p>“Remember, prisons keep records, now, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about that, sir!”</p>

<p>“Agreed, my boy! now look’ee, for the friends of the
family, for <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, the wench <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, and the rest of the pals,
you shall be ‘Little Tremendous,’ that’s settled. Then,
if clients come to see me, well, I’ll give you a title of ceremony—d’you
cotton to that?”</p>

<p>“I’m agreeable.”</p>

<p>“I shall call <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellips">...</span> let me <span class="prellips">see </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I’ll call you my
‘Chief of Staff.’ That’ll put a stopper on their gab.”</p>

<p>“No doubt it will, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>.”</p>

<p>It was in a dull, depressed, specious, fawning voice
that <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> replied to his new “master.”</p>

<p>In the garret where the dreadful old fellow stored his
archives, huge masses of dusty paper, cheek by jowl with
all sorts of miscellaneous rubbish, worthless bric-à-brac,
old worn-out furniture, clothes fit only for a hand-me-down
shop, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had passed a not too uncomfortable night.</p>

<p>Accordingly he had risen in a cheerful frame of mind.
A hasty wash at a trickle of cold water that escaped with
a nerve-racking noise from a leaky tap on the landing
outside his door, had quite made him his own man again.
Whistling a tune he had rejoined <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>.</p>

<p><a id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Now, sir,” he had asked, “you have work for me to do,
eh, in your place of business?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, already ensconced in a leather armchair,
from which tags of the horsehair stuffing stuck out in all
directions, but which formed a permanent seat of state
behind his desk, loaded with multitudinous papers, had
nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Work? Yes, my young friend, yes; at my place there’s
always work to do, only as there’s not always cash, for
times are hard, we must settle about conditions. I offer
you board and lodging, and now and again a bit of
<span class="prellips">money </span><span class="ellips">...</span> does that suit your book?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> would have thought himself in heaven,
had not the dubious looks of the unpleasant old man driven
all celestial ideas clean out of his head.</p>

<p>“That’ll do me,” was as much as he had cared to
say.</p>

<p>Thereupon the worthy <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> had proceeded to put
a number of leading questions.</p>

<p>What could <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> do? Write? Yes<span class="ellips">?...</span> Good.
That was capital. He could draw, too? then he could
draw signatures? in fact, copy signatures, eh? copy them,
you know, eh? Yes, again? Better and <span class="prellips">better </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
The old man seemed delighted.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had judicially sized up his new employer by this
time; yes, there was no doubt he could be of great service
to him on occasions.</p>

<p>Then <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> had asked the young man to tell him
precisely who and what he was. But on that point, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
had proved reticent to the last degree.</p>

<p>“I’ve got pals,” this was all he would say, “who have
nicknamed me ‘Little Tremendous,’ because I’m pretty
nimble with my maulies and ain’t afraid to use ’em.”</p>

<p>The information was vague enough. But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was
not the man to insist on any excessive precision of statement.
He felt little doubt his new clerk must have had
a somewhat chequered past. If it didn’t suit him to let
out exactly who he was, well, that was his <span class="prellips">business </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
And that was why <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, after informing <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> that
he would be where clients were concerned the “Chief of
Staff” in his office, addressed the young man familiarly
by the name he had chosen to give himself.</p>

 ></span></span></a>“Look here, young Handy Man, I’m going to send you
on an errand.”</p>

<p>“Very good, <span lang="fr">M’sieu Moche</span>.”</p>

<p>“An errand to a pretty girl’s<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>“Better still, <span lang="fr">M’sieu Moche</span>.”</p>

<p>“But no nonsense, you know! it’s a serious matter, and
you must be serious. No larks with the girl, she’s going
to be my tenant.”</p>

<p>“You’re a house owner then, <span lang="fr">M’sieu Moche</span>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy, a house owner, but a poor, hard-up one
at that; don’t you go and think I’m a <span class="prellips">millionaire </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
Anyhow, I’ve a bit of a place where the young lady in
question has rented a flat.”</p>

<p>“And that’s where I’m to go, <span lang="fr">M’sieu Moche</span>?”</p>

<p>“No, my ‘Little Tremendous,’ you’re to go to the <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Rue
des Couronnes </span><span class="ellips">...</span> d’you hear? the <span lang="fr">Rue des Couronnes</span>
while <em>my</em> house stands in the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Evangile</span>.”</p>

<p>“Now I can’t quite follow you, <span lang="fr">M’sieu Moche</span>.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you talk too much, my lad! Shut
your trap a bit, and I’ll explain.”</p>

<p>“Shut it is, <span lang="fr">M’sieu Moche</span>.”</p>

<p>“Good! well, here’s how it is: The lady has hired my
flat; only as I can’t say if she’ll fork out the tin regularly,
I should like you to go and have a look what furniture
she’s got, to know if it’s good to cover the quarter’s rent.”</p>

<p>“Good, <span lang="fr">M’sieu Moche</span>.”</p>

<p>“You twig—do what I tell you without seeming to, eh?”</p>

<p>“In that case, I’d want an excuse, eh?”</p>

<p>“I never said I couldn’t provide one, did I? Look’ee,
my son, search under that green bookcase and you’ll find
some patterns of <span class="prellips">wall-papers </span><span class="ellips">...</span> got ’em?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, take ’em with you, young sir! For the last six
months I’ve found ’em useful for the same little game.
You see, I send a pal, as it might be you, to call on the guy
who wants to take my rooms. He comes under pretence
of offering the new tenant a choice of wall-papers; as a
matter of fact, I simply use him to inspect the furniture
that must guarantee the rent. As you may suppose, I
never do pay for the papering. Not much! The offer’s
made—and there it ends!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> showed no surprise. The business his strange
<a id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>employer was sending him on was of course perfectly
straightforward and legitimate! Still keeping to his slangy
way of speaking, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> merely asked:</p>

<p>“And what’s the name, <span lang="fr">M’sieu Moche</span>, your dicky-bird
goes by? and what’s her exact address in the <span lang="fr">Rue des
Couronnes</span>?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, while talking to his clerk, was busy changing
his down-at-heel slippers for a pair of elastic-sided boots,
obviously too small for him, the whitey-brown cracks in
which he masked by smearing them with ink. He was
bending down behind his desk and could not see the other’s
face as he answered his last question:</p>

<p>“The dicky-bird, as you call her, lives, to be exact, at
142 <span lang="fr"><i>bis</i> Rue des Couronnes</span>. As to her name, that’s pretty
well-known, she’s the sister of a man who was murdered;
you can’t help remembering about it; she’s called
<span lang="fr">Mademoiselle Elisabeth Dollon</span>—you’ll not forget?”</p>

<p>In a shaking voice it needed an almost superhuman
effort to steady, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> promised he would not
forget the name! A thousand thoughts were whirling
madly through his brain, his heart was still beating high
with excitement, when <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> went on:</p>

<p>“Well then, hook it, my boy; here’s three half-pence
for going, to pay your Underground; it’s not far, you can
walk back.”</p>

<p>Yes, he could walk back quite well, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> agreed,
hardly conscious of what he was saying.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he was on his way to the <span lang="fr">Rue des
Couronnes</span>.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>! He was going, he, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>,
to see <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>! As if the past had suddenly risen
before his eyes as on the film of an imaginary cinematograph
of dreams, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> lived again in pain and
grief the torturing crises, the grim tragedies that name
called back to memory, a woman’s name, the name of
<span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>. No, never had he forgotten the pathetic
heroine of those terrible days.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>, the unhappy sister of the painter,
<span lang="fr">Jacques Dollon, Fantômas’</span> victim, deemed by some to be
himself <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> till the day when <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
rehabilitated his good name, was she not the only being
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> cherished with a fond affection? Since the first
<a id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>day he had learnt to know her, to appreciate the girl’s
proud and tender character, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> had loved her!</p>

<p>It was for her, to do her honour, to rescue her from the
most odious entanglements, that he had in those days
devoted himself, body and soul, to the task of clearing up
the mysterious affair of the <cite>Messenger of Death</cite>. Twenty
times over, in the course of that police investigation, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
and <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had risked their lives. <span lang="fr">Juve</span> for his part was
acting more for the sake of unmasking <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> than for
any other reason, but for <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, he was spurred on by the
interest he felt in <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>.</p>

<p>Once, for a moment, he had believed his dearest wishes
would be fulfilled. Then, at that very instant of joyful
satisfaction, an appalling catastrophe had destroyed his
hopes. The prey he was tracking down escaped, and
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, to crown his victory, in eluding the wiles of his
two pursuers, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> and <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, had the cruelty to add yet
another triumph. He wrote to <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>—already
his victim—“<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> is <span lang="fr">Charles Rambert; Charles Rambert</span>
is a criminal and a coward,” with the result that,
terrified by this false and treacherous calumny, she avoided
the young man, vanished from his life, swore she would
never see him more!</p>

<p>And now, now when he was poor, helpless, condemned
to live in company of bandits, apaches, the dregs of society,
Fate gave him this sublime recompense, sending him this
day to see whom? whom but <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>!</p>

<p>“To see her, heavens! to see her! to tell her who I am,
what I am, what I live for, to win a half-hour of sweet,
calm converse with her, wherein to convince her of the
truth, to explain to her <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> machinations, oh! it is
too much happiness!” <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> strove to regain
his self-possession, to master his nerves, but his pace was
headlong as he sped to the <span lang="fr">Rue des Couronnes</span>, where he
hoped to win at last an unfeigned declaration of renewed
affection from <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>.</p>

<p>“I shall know very well,” he murmured to himself at
intervals. “I shall know how to show her I love her truly.
By the ardour of my words I shall gain her confidence, the
confidence she <em>must</em> grant me, which I <em>must</em> have, that she
may feel I speak the truth, that I am not what <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
has told her I was.”</p>

<p><a id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Arrived at 142 <span lang="fr"><i>bis</i> Rue des Couronnes, Fandor</span> found
the house a crowded nest of working people’s flats. Along
a narrow, fetid passage, its damp walls stained and scarred
over with inscriptions indicating the names of the tenants
and the different floors they occupied, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> penetrated
to the concierge’s lodge. He tried to push open the door,
but it would not yield.</p>

<p>“So,” thought the young man, “the woman is not
within.” He called: “Anyone there?” but his voice was
drowned by a deafening noise proceeding from a tiny
courtyard near by.</p>

<p>Turning his steps in that direction, he discovered a
woman busy with two sticks beating clouds of dust out of
an unstitched mattress.</p>

<p>“The concierge?” asked the visitor.</p>

<p>The woman broke off her work to demand in a grumbling
voice:</p>

<p>“What do you want with her, eh?”</p>

<p>“To inquire for a tenant’s rooms.”</p>

<p>“What tenant?”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Mlle. Dollon</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Mlle. Dollon</span>? And what may you want with her?”</p>

<p>Surprised at this discouraging reception, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, who
was anything but patience personified, merely declared:</p>

<p>“That I propose to tell <span lang="fr">Mlle. Dollon</span> herself in good
time.”</p>

<p>But the virago had picked up her sticks again, preparatory
to resuming her work.</p>

<p>“To begin with,” she announced, “you’ll not say anything
at all to her, because you’re not going up to see her.”</p>

<p>“Not going up to see her! and pray, why?”</p>

<p>“That’s the orders she’s given me—that’s why!”</p>

<p>“Then you are the concierge?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am. What then?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> realized he would inevitably be shown
the door unless he could secure the good graces of this
vixen who was so conscientious in the matter of obeying
orders.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he now addressed her in his most winning
voice, forgetting how strange it sounded for an apache,
such as he looked in his disreputable clothes, to be speaking
in tones of perfect politeness. “Madam, you would
<a id="png.052" href="#png.052"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>oblige me very greatly by informing me why <span lang="fr">Mlle. Dollon</span>
cannot receive me. I have not come to trouble her unduly.
I am here to offer her a choice of wall-papers for the rooms
she is moving into.”</p>

<p>The young man had found an excellent way to conciliate
the good woman. He had called her “Madam,” whereas
in the <i lang="fr">quartier</i> she was invariably addressed as “mother”
so-and-so, by reason of her enormous bulk.</p>

<p>“Well, my good sir,” replied the fat portress, suddenly
disarmed, “I’ll tell you something; come along in to my
lodge and I’ll have a peer first at your patterns, and if
there’s any that look like suiting her book, I’ll go up and
show her them, or you shall go up yourself. She and I
have the same taste in wall-papers.”</p>

<p>Be sure <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> took care to express no doubts on the
latter point, albeit it struck him as highly improbable that
the fat concierge should share the same tastes as the artist,
<span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>; he readily enough agreed:</p>

<p>“After you, madam,”—and, preceded by the fat woman
trotting along in front of him, this being her own way of
moving rapidly, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> advanced into the concierge’s
lodge.</p>

<p>“First of all,” began his hostess graciously, “so as our
talk may go easier, I’ll tell you my name; it’s <span lang="fr">Mme. Doulenques</span>. Now, you mustn’t bear malice because I was
a bit rough with you just at first. The fact is the young
lady is still upset after her adventure.”</p>

<p>Boiling with impatience, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> wished <span lang="fr">Mme. Doulenques</span>
to the devil; the all-important thing for him was to see
<span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>. Mighty little he cared to listen to the fat
creature’s babble. But there, to hustle her was impossible.
He questioned:</p>

<p>“Her adventure? <span lang="fr">Mlle. Elisabeth Dollon</span><span class="ellipsp">?...</span>”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; you haven’t heard? Ah! true, they didn’t
put it in the papers. Well, just imagine, Mr. Paperer, the
poor, gentle lamb, yesterday evening as she was coming
home from her work, was attacked by apaches.”</p>

<p>“Great heavens! not seriously hurt, I trust?”</p>

<p>“No, not much the worse certainly, seeing as how she
escaped in time; but it was touch and go; she got back
here terribly upset, poor child! That’s why she won’t see
anybody to-day<!-- TN: hyphen added for consistency -->.”</p>

<p><a id="png.053" href="#png.053"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> seized the opportunity to cut short the conversation.</p>

<p>“I see; but she will see me, for sure, as I’ve come about
decorating the <span class="prellips">rooms </span><span class="ellips">...</span> what floor does she live on?”</p>

<p>“Fifth floor, <span class="prellips">left </span><span class="ellips">...</span> bell with a green <span class="prellips">bell-pull </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
But just wait till I tell you all about it. Just think, it
was on the <span lang="fr">Boulevard de Belleville</span> it all happened.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Boulevard de Belleville</span><span class="ellips">!...</span> yesterday evening?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yesterday <span class="nw">evening—”</span></p>

<p>The young man had asked the question in such a strange
voice that <span lang="fr">Mme. Doulenques</span> felt her earlier doubts more
than justified.</p>

<p>“Now, whatever’s the matter?” she demanded, “One
would think you’d been taken ill.”</p>

<p>Indeed, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had turned deadly pale as he listened
to the woman’s story. The coincidence was so startling—<span lang="fr">Elisabeth
Dollon</span>, the very evening before, assailed by
apaches on the <span lang="fr">Boulevard de Belleville</span>; then, on the same
boulevard, not far away no doubt, he, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, defending
an unknown woman against police <span class="prellips">officers </span><span class="ellips">...</span></p>

<p>The concierge took up the tale again:</p>

<p>“And the worst part of the story you haven’t heard yet.
Mr. Paperer—she knows the villain who assaulted her!
Seems it’s one <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, a low fellow who once had to do
with her, and who <span class="prellips">actually </span><span class="ellips">...</span> Why, what’s wrong
with you now<span class="ellips">?...</span> God bless my soul! stop him!”</p>

<p>Spinning round on his heels, like a madman, <span lang="fr">Jérôme
Fandor</span> had abruptly left fat <span lang="fr">Mme. Doulenques</span> in the very
middle of her narrative.</p>

<p>And truly it was a mad thing the journalist had been
guilty of in so acting. Commonly so careful and deliberate,
so much master of his feelings, for this once he had failed
to govern an overmastering impulse. So <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>
was the workgirl he had saved the night before from the
pursuit of the street patrol! And <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> believed that
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, whom she had had time to recognize, was
one of her assailants! What cared he now for any further
details <span lang="fr">Mme. Doulenques</span> might have to give?</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> lived on the fifth floor, and thither he rushed,
panting, filled with a frantic eagerness to proclaim his
innocence to the woman he loved, to clear up this new, this
fatal misunderstanding. While the portress, in sheer terror
<a id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the man’s strange behaviour, in the very middle of a
conversation bolting away like a thief to dash up to her
tenant’s rooms, was screaming hoarse, half-stifled cries for
help, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> sprang up the stairs four steps at a
time.</p>

<p>Yes, there on the fifth floor he saw to his left a door with
a green bell-pull beside it. He rang a peal, so loud and
peremptory he could hear someone on the other side of
the door hurrying forward at a run. A voice, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth’s</span>
voice, challenged:</p>

<p>“Who’s there? What’s wanted?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had a gleam of common sense, enough to make
him disguise his voice:</p>

<p>“Someone from <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> to see <span lang="fr">Mlle. Elisabeth
Dollon</span>.”</p>

<p>There was a sound of a key turning in the lock and the
door fell ajar, while <span lang="fr">Jérôme</span> could faintly catch a confused
clamour reaching him from the courtyard below.</p>

<p>“You want to see me, sir?” and cautiously the occupant
of the flat—doubtless the young woman had been resting
on her bed and had hurriedly thrown a <i lang="fr">peignoir</i> round her—opened
the door a little wider.</p>

<p>Alas! hardly had she cast eyes on the visitor before she
turned livid and tried to pull the door to again, screaming:
“Help! help<span class="ellips">!...</span> <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellips">...</span> you, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span><span class="ellips">!...</span>
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span><span class="ellips">!...</span> I am undone!”</p>

<p>Instinctively throwing his weight against the door,
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> endeavoured to prevent the girl from shutting him
out. “For heaven’s sake,” he prayed her, “calm yourself!—yes,
it is <span class="prellips">I </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I <span lang="fr">Fandor</span><span class="ellips">!...</span> who loves you<span class="ellips">....</span>
Listen to me, I beseech you!”</p>

<p>But with a sudden, desperate effort, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>
had dragged the door to again, not without giving vent to
another cry of frantic terror: “Help! it is <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Fantômas <span class="ellips">...</span>
Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>All this had occupied but a moment, and already <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
was regaining his composure. That <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>, terribly
upset by last night’s violence, in which she believed him to
have been concerned, took him for <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, was after
all of small importance. He could easily convince her of
the truth. What was more serious was the monstrous
folly he had committed in bolting away in that
<a id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>unceremonious fashion from <span lang="fr">Mme. Doulenques</span> a moment before.
Now on the stairs a prodigious uproar was swelling louder
and louder, while the shrill voice of the concierge rose high
above the clamour:</p>

<p>“A scoundrelly brigand, I tell you! one of the same lot
for sure who attacked the girl yesterday!” People were
thronging upstairs, heavy footsteps sounded on the boards,
a crowd of neighbours was hurrying up to the scene of
action.</p>

<p>Instinctively <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> stepped back on the landing. For
nearly six months he had been living the life of a fugitive;
for all those months the unfortunate young man had known
the gnawing anxieties of a never-ending flight from all
whose interest it might be to discover his identity. Now,
finding himself pursued, trapped on this stairway, he lost
his head. Instead of quietly waiting till the concierge
and her satellites came up to him and then explaining the
misunderstanding, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, realizing that <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> would
be long in recognizing her mistake, resolved to fly. Swiftly,
noiselessly, nimbly, he mounted to the seventh story of
the house, in the vague hope of finding a hiding-place.</p>

<p>Fortune favoured him. The house was an enormous
block of workmen’s dwellings, made up of several separate
buildings, connected together and served by several different
staircases. <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, following the corridor running between
the rooms on the topmost floor, had the luck to come upon
the landing of a second flight of stairs. To make up his
mind, to dart to the top, to scamper down the stairway,
never stopping to know what had become of his pursuers,
to dash into the street and reach the line of the outer
boulevards at a run, was the work of a moment. Bathed
in sweat and panting for breath, he reached the <span lang="fr">Boulevard
de Belleville</span>—and knew he was safe.</p>

<p>Safe, yes, but alas! atrociously disappointed. An hour
ago he was on his way, in joyful anticipation, to visit
<span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>, blessing the happy chance that was to
bring him to the girl’s presence; now he had but caught a
glimpse of her, had not so much as spoken with her; all
he knew was that she believed him guilty of the most
dreadful crimes, that she coupled his name with a name of
horror, a name of blood, a name of panic terror, with the
name of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! Exhausted, he sank on a bench.
<a id="png.056" href="#png.056"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>All day long, crushed by the hand of Fate that day by day
accumulated ever-fresh calamities on his devoted head,
he wandered miserably about the streets.</p>

<p>At nightfall he regained some degree of self-possession.</p>

<p>“I must think out a plan,” he told himself; “I know
now where she lives, I know where she is going to live, by
the Lord, I can surely contrive to clear my character in her
eyes.” His aimless wanderings had led him to the neighbourhood
of <span lang="fr">Père-Lachaise</span>, and he now set out slowly and
sadly on his way back to the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>.</p>

<p>“I will tell <span lang="fr">Moche</span>,” he thought to himself, “that I
waited for <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> all day, and have not seen <span class="prellips">her </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
or else I will assure him her furniture is good <span class="prellips">enough </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
or, better still, as it’s nine o’clock at night, I will slip up to
my garret, of which I have a key, without seeing my worthy
master at all. To-morrow I shall be calmer, and can then
see what’s best to be done.”</p>

 ><small>PRISONER OF THE LANTERN</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">For</span> nearly two hours, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> had been back in
his garret, the lumber-room <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> had put at his
disposal, albeit without making any further provision for
his accommodation beyond supplying a tiny lamp to give
him a glimmer of light. But the journalist was not yet
asleep. Kneeling on the floor, his lamp in front of him,
he was reading and re-reading the evening paper, <cite lang="fr">La
Capitale</cite>, which he had bought with the sacrifice of one
of the three sous presented to him that morning by his
generous master. What he read was of the deepest interest
and importance to <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>. The young man was trembling
in every limb, his face wore an expression of horror and
consternation; at intervals he punctuated his perusal with
half-stifled exclamations and frantic ejaculations of dismay:</p>

<p>“What <em>does</em> it mean<span class="ellips">?...</span> the audacity of it<span class="ellips">!...</span>
the unspeakable effrontery<span class="ellips">!...</span> Are we on the eve of
a Reign of Terror<span class="ellips">?...</span> After six months’ truce, are
we to behold once more this figure of ill-omen rise threatening,
terrifying, on the horizon<span class="ellips">?...</span> And to think of it,
my name too, on all men’s lips<span class="ellips">!...</span> Confusion twice
confounded! once again the man succeeds in thrusting on
another the responsibility for his crimes<span class="ellips">!...</span> a Minister
kidnapped<span class="ellips">!...</span> the Chamber in consternation<span class="ellips">!...</span>
The whole country attacked in the person of its highest
representatives<span class="ellips">!...</span> Ah! <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is indeed a genius,
the genius of audacity, the king of frightfulness, the monster
that assails everything, that fears nothing, for whom nothing
is sacred!”</p>

<p>For the tenth time, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> re-read the article in <cite lang="fr">La
Capitale</cite>. On regaining the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>, worn out
by the stress and strain of his visit to <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>, he had
heard the newsboys crying at the top of their voices the
latest edition of <cite lang="fr">La Capitale</cite>. People were fighting for
<a id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the paper, passers-by reading the news with looks of horror
and feverish excitement. No sooner had <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> cast his
eyes on the copy he had secured than he started violently.
In enormous letters he read the headlines:</p>

<p>“<i><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> at work again.—A Minister carried off by
brigands.—<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> demands a million francs to disappear.
The Chamber votes defiance.</i>”</p>

<p>Now, back in his garret two hours ago, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was
reading, still incapable, in the mad whirl of his thoughts,
of regaining anything like calmness, the amazing details
of the extraordinary sitting of the Chamber, the Chamber
wherein <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had thrown defiance, a veritable ultimatum
to France, the sitting that had been held that same
afternoon at the moment he was on his way to <span lang="fr">Mlle.
Dollon’s</span>.</p>

<p>That <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> should strike a sudden blow, he reflected,
a blow so extraordinary as the one he has just delivered, is
astounding, but it is not perhaps so crushing as I thought
at first. In any case, what a fine argument it supplies in
<span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> defence. If <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> manifests his activity abroad,
in public, why, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> can no longer be confounded with him,
seeing <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is a prisoner in the <span lang="fr">Santé</span>!</p>

<p>Then, with ever increasing agitation, the journalist began
to read the passage in the paper giving the shorthand report
of the debate in the Chamber, which stated how his name,
his, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor’s</span> name, had been uttered aloud as
probably masking that of one of <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> chief
accomplices.</p>

<p>“By the Lord!” soliloquized the young man, “it’s plain
enough; everybody believes that <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! Now
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> is in gaol, debarred from action; the inevitable conclusion,
therefore, is that one of his lieutenants, one of his
accomplices, must be credited with the atrocity of to-day.
As I am known to be <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> bosom friend, it is naturally
on me the police fix their suspicions, it is against me the
public launches its accusations. Yes, the game is up, my
fate is sealed; no stone will be left unturned to hunt me
down and arrest me.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> reflections might have lasted longer yet perhaps,
he might perhaps have thought out a plan of escape, for he
felt convinced the bloodhounds of the Prefecture of Police
would find little difficulty in tracking him down to <span lang="fr">Père
<a id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Moche’s</span>, if he had not of a sudden had the impression of
footsteps, stealthy footsteps, at his side. Springing instantly
to his feet, the young man challenged: “Who goes
there?” but there was no answer, the garret was absolutely
silent.</p>

<p>“Yet surely I was not dreaming?” he muttered. Holding
his breath, motionless as a statue, the journalist waited
with ears astrain. But no, he must have been mistaken;
there was not a thing to attract his attention.</p>

<p>“I’m getting nervous,” he muttered; “true, I’ve good
reason to be just now.”</p>

<p>He made a tour of inspection, but found nothing that
seemed suspicious. This done, he returned and knelt
down again in front of <cite lang="fr">La Capitale</cite>, where the paper lay
open on the floor. He was on the point of resuming
reading when he had the same unaccountable impression
again. This time it was certain, definite, unmistakable.
He had felt a current of air pass like a breath over his face.
It was no hallucination, for the journal he was reading had
half lifted from the ground, the unshaded flame of the
lamp had flickered. Once more he started up, again he
made the tour of his cockloft.</p>

<p>“Nothing there!” he muttered, “nothing at all!”</p>

<p>But as he was returning slowly, hesitatingly, to the middle
of the room, with pursed lips and frowning brow, suddenly,
with a sharp pop, his lamp went out, while whirling before
a powerful draught, <cite lang="fr">La Capitale</cite> fluttered across the floor.
It was stupefying! Instinctively, in the pale moonlight,
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> stepped across the garret, meaning to set his back
against the wall, in case of further eventualities. But he
had not taken three steps before a choking cry escaped him.
Thrown with horrid violence, a lasso had wound itself
about his throat! He was dragged to the ground, his
limbs paralysed, half strangled, half dead!</p>

<p>Then, with horror unspeakable, he looked and <span class="prellips">saw </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
The window of the attic, a dormer window, had been opened
noiselessly. Clinging to the crossbar of the casement a
dim shape was silhouetted against the starlit sky. At a
glance <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> recognized the sinister apparition. It was
a man clad in black, close-fitting tights, the face hidden
in a deep cowl, the shoulders wrapped in a great black
cloak! A figure of horror, at once clearly defined and
<a id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>indistinct, a shape that absorbed in the darkness, momentarily
disappeared, only to reappear in darkling outline
on the whiter background of the wall; it was the figure
of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!</p>

<p>In a single second <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had felt himself caught by
the lasso, in one second he had been thrown to the ground,
in one second he had noted the black, fantastic form of the
bandit glide into the garret—and in that one second he
recognized beyond possibility of doubt the Monarch of
Crime, the Master of Terror!</p>

<p>It was <span lang="fr">Fantômas! Fantômas</span>, and no other!</p>

<p>A grim apparition—this hooded man—this man who
now held <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, his relentless pursuer, at his mercy.
The journalist had fallen into the trap laid for him; he
thought: “I am in <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> power! I am a lost man!”</p>

<p>To move a limb was impossible, to resist a wild dream.
Yet no sooner had he gathered a clear idea of the danger
threatening him than, calm again and confident, he waited
events.</p>

<p>Swift and silent, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> stepped over the crossbar
of the window, sprang down into the room, and to <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span>
side where he lay stretched helpless on the floor. In a
turn of the hand he made fast the knots of his lasso, gagged
the young man, then slackened the ligature that was almost
strangling him, and this done, fell to taunting his victim
with odious mockery. But what a strange voice, toneless,
metallic, scarce human, it was that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> adopted!</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>, good-day to you! <span lang="fr">Monsieur Jérôme
Fandor, Fantômas</span> presents you his compliments.”</p>

<p>Helpless, gagged, bound hand and foot, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> could
made no reply whatsoever. Only the eyes were alive in
the dead face, and in those eyes <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> concentrated
all his power of resolution. With calm intensity
he fixed his gaze on his enemy’s face, on the eyes that
glittered luminous under the black folds of the impenetrable
mask, staring back unflinching.</p>

<p>“He can kill me,” thought the young man, “he shall
never think he can frighten me!”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had dropped his bantering tone, and it
was in a serious voice he now spoke:</p>

<p>“You were reading <cite lang="fr">La Capitale</cite>, so you know the latest
news? Interesting, is it not<span class="ellips">?...</span> Unfortunately,
<a id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>, the fools have thought fit to lay to your
account the claim formulated by me against Parliament.
At this moment the police are looking for you, tracking
you down, determined to arrest you. A pity, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>!
no, I could never allow that; I like you too <span class="prellips">well </span><span class="ellips">...</span> In
ten minutes officers will be entering this room to arrest you.
But never fear, have no anxiety! If I am here, it is simply
and solely to help you escape their reach; surely <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
owes this much to you, to protect you against your friends,
the agents of the law!”</p>

<p>A peal of laughter emphasized the bandit’s last words,
and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was still pondering what precisely these expressions
signified when <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> turned his attention to
a task the object of which seemed quite inexplicable. He
proceeded to drag out into the middle of the floor a tall
stool, and depositing it there, climbed on the top, a
manœuvre<!-- TN: original reads "manoeuvre", altered for consistency --> which brought him on a level with an enormous
Chinese lantern, one of those huge lanterns of wrought
iron and coloured glass, of the kind to be seen in the streets
of Pekin, and which are sometimes imported from the
East to be suspended in the vestibules of houses. By
what strange chances the thing had come to be hanging
from the ceiling of old <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span> garret, it would be hard to
say. Anyway, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> must long ago have noticed its
being there. He leant over towards it, opened the door,
and this done, descended from his perch.</p>

<p>“There, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>,” he announced, “inside
there, you’ll be in the best boxes for seeing the play—I
may say in the grated boxes, for I’m pretty confident nobody
will see you. One can see from within outwards, but not
the reverse way.”</p>

<p>With a catlike dexterity, the man slipped off the long,
black coat enveloping him in its folds, and without seeming
to make any special effort, took up <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> on his shoulders,
mounted the stool once more, and deposited the young
man in the interior of the lantern!</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Journalist, I refasten the door, by way of
precaution, but I give you full leave to look out of the
window to see what happens. You’ll see, not a doubt of
it, the way <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> fights for his friends, and even for
you, his enemy!”</p>

<p>Yes, he would look, no fear of that—and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, still
<a id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bound and ensconced inside the Chinese lantern, into
which <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had forced him, his limbs cramped, his
flesh bruised by the cords, half stilling, glued his face to the
painted panes of his extraordinary prison.</p>

<p>Jumping down again, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> set to work with the
very utmost rapidity. He pushed back the stool against
the wall. He hauled up against the door a huge trunk
stuffed full of papers to reinforce the crazy panels. From
his pocket he extracted a screwdriver, and in a very few
minutes had taken off the lock. Then, kneeling against
the trunk, he produced a revolver, the nickel-plated barrel
of which glittered in the moonlight, and passing the muzzle
through the loophole where the lock had been torn away,
waited events.</p>

<p>Minute after minute passed in deadly silence. Presently,
as often happens in the most tragic situations, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
in the midst of all his poignant anxieties, began to be
tormented by yet another apprehension—a fantastic fear
that the lantern in which <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had imprisoned him
was not strong enough to bear his weight.</p>

<p>“I’m going to come tumbling down!” thought the
journalist, “to come tumbling down directly, with a crash
of broken glass and an appalling rattle. That’s something
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> has failed to foresee. Pray God, it might upset
his plans!”</p>

<p>But the lantern held firm, and by the time he had been
a quarter of an hour shut up in his odd prison-cell, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
had ceased to give a thought to the possibility of taking a
fall. His whole attention was again concentrated on
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>; but the brigand remained perfectly still and
seemed to have forgotten the other’s very existence. On
his knees, his revolver all the time pointed through the
improvised loophole, he was evidently watching for the
arrival of someone or something.</p>

<p>And it was in a flash, without his having so much as
given a start, or moved a muscle, or uttered an exclamation,
that the sharp explosion of his weapon rang out, followed
by the dull thud of a body dropping!</p>

<p>Instantly the whole house resounded with cries of pain,
shouts and screams and the din of tramping feet. “Go
on! break in the door!” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> heard a voice yelling.
Next moment two more shots tore the air, two other voices
<a id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bellowed in agony, two more wounded men sank heavily
to the ground; then a mighty thrust shook the door and
overset the trunk.</p>

<p>With one bound, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> was at the window, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
had disappeared, yelling as he vanished: “Hurrah!
three officers brought down! hurrah!” while into the garret,
preceded by the blinding rays of electric torches, sprang a
whole troop of men, shouting, swearing, revolvers in hand.</p>

<p>A prisoner in his lantern, still gagged, still tied hand
and foot, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> seemed the victim of an atrocious nightmare.
Scarce had the men entered the room before <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
realized the full horror of his situation, guessed the whole
secret of the villainous design. The men were police officers,
they were shouting: “<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, hands up! or
you are a dead man.”</p>

<p>Then they began to search the garret, to turn everything
upside down, to hunt about, to <em>hunt for him</em>! The young
man felt a cold sweat bead his temples. What had been
in <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> mind? He knew it only too well. The brigand
had spared his life once more only to keep alive the man
who he was planning should bear the whole weight of
responsibility for his, <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> acts. If he had pinioned
the journalist instead of killing him, it was because <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
was now marked down by public odium as being <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.
He had hidden him in the lantern, he had taken post behind
the door, he had three several times fired on the police and
disappeared, all this only because he chose to make men
think that <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>—the man they were come to arrest—was
really <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, and that it was he, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>—not
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>—who had used his revolver to such deadly
effect!</p>

<p>“Let the lantern give way,” thought the prisoner, “and
tumble me into the middle of the constables, and I’m
done for! they will kill me—and they will be justified.”</p>

<p>Meantime the empty garret was the scene of a frenzied
search. The police, who had invaded the place like pillagers
into a captured city, were now convinced that the man
they sought for had escaped. “The scoundrel!” screamed
one of them, who running to the window had discovered
a rope hanging from it, the rope that doubtless had helped
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> to escape over the roofs, “the scoundrel!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> could not see the man well, but he had a better
<a id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>view of another officer who answered him; it was <span lang="fr">Michel</span>,
Inspector <span lang="fr">Michel</span>, who had once served under <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> orders!
“My word,” the Inspector was saying, “but the villain
had planned it all to rights. He was expecting us; while
we were breaking in the door, he had plenty of time to get
away<span class="ellips">....</span> Curse him! to think three of us have got
themselves knocked out of time!”</p>

<p>But at this point a constable who was still busy turning
out a corner of the garret, interrupted his chief by a sharp
exclamation: “Look, sir, just look here!”—“What is it?”—It
was a small, shiny object—<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> could see it quite
plainly from his eyrie in the lantern—which the man held
out for his chief’s inspection. The latter seemed prodigiously
surprised at sight of it:</p>

<p>“God bless us! where did you find that?”</p>

<p>“In the corner over <span class="prellips">there </span><span class="ellips">...</span> It means something,
that does.”</p>

<p>“Means something<span class="ellips">?...</span> It means everything!”</p>

<p>The other men had gathered round the two:</p>

<p>“What is it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Look! an astonishing find! <span lang="fr">Léon</span> has just picked up
a button of the uniform the collectors of the <span lang="fr">Comptoir
National</span> wear.”</p>

<p>While this was going on, a series of ominous cracks had
seriously alarmed the unfortunate young man who was
still hunched up on his uncomfortable perch. Meantime,
however, the police officers had disconsolately taken their
departure; they had arrived a dozen men, they returned
to headquarters only nine.</p>

<p>Hardly had the constables gone when, suddenly, in a
moment, without further warning, the bottom of the Chinese
lantern fell out. With a mighty crash <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> tumbled out
on to the floor. Luckily, the ceiling was low; the young
man was not hurt, but he lay stunned on the ground,
and for some seconds did not know where he was. Then,
quickly, with his usual courage, he regained command of
himself.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he reflected, “I made a hideous noise
in falling. Unless everybody is out of the house helping to
remove the wounded men, they’ll come here with a rush and
find me.” Then, straining his muscles almost to cracking
point, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, in spite of the intolerable pain these
<a id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>efforts caused him, struggled to unloose his bonds; at all
costs he must regain his liberty.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he muttered at last. “I think, down my
<span class="prellips">legs </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>” the rope that tied his ankles together had,
in fact, yielded a little to his strenuous exertions. A few
seconds more, and the rope came loose, he could shake off
the coils altogether. He was able to get on his feet, he
could get an arm free, unbind his fastenings altogether.
But so cramped were his limbs, so numbed by long confinement,
that the first step he tried to take, he staggered and
had to sit down again.</p>

<p>“If they come up and find me,” he told himself again,
“I am done for!”</p>

<p>But little by little the circulation was restored; he could
stand on his feet, he could walk!</p>

<p>Then, with the swiftness of decision that was characteristic
of him, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, without an instant’s hesitation,
hurried to the window and leant out over the sill.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” he muttered; “the police have forgotten
to remove the rope, or more likely they have left it there
as a piece of evidence in view of the further inquiries they
mean to institute, no doubt. Good! Where <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
found a way, I shall know how to follow his lead. But
quick! quick! there’s not a moment to lose.”</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. Following <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> example
he climbed over the sill, seized the rope and let himself
slide down into the void below. The night had turned
dark, and the moon was hidden. As the journalist descended,
he could barely make out, some yards below him,
the dim outline of the roof of a tall building, and beyond
again an endless succession of other roofs, broken by a
forest of chimneys rising like spectres into the night sky.</p>

 ><small><span lang="fr">FANTÔMAS’</span> ULTIMATUM</small></h2>


<p class="noindent">“<span class="smc">Long</span> live the Minister of Justice! Bravo, <span lang="fr">Ferrand</span>!
bravo! bravo!” These and the like cordial acclamations
were still echoing in <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand’s</span> ears as the Minister,
in his elegant livery brougham, returned calmly and peaceably
to the <span lang="fr">Place Vendôme</span> about one o’clock in the morning,
accompanied only by his Parliamentary Secretary, the
<span lang="fr">Conseiller Navarret</span>. <span lang="fr">Ferrand</span> was on his way back from
the grand amphitheatre of the <span lang="fr">Sorbonne</span>, where he had
presided over an associated meeting of the students in law.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> was a man of boundless ambition. A
General Practitioner in the provinces, and in no way
interested in the science he practised, he had found himself
from earliest manhood attracted, fascinated by the allurements
and difficulties of politics. His profession as a
doctor, a profession he exercised with a calculated generosity,
provided admirable opportunities for winning the
suffrages of his fellow citizens. At thirty-four he had been
elected Deputy.</p>

<p>Eighteen months later, having attracted the favourable
notice of the Chamber by his wise common sense, and the
maturity of his views, he was invited by <span lang="fr">Monnier</span> to join
his Cabinet in the position of an Under Secretary of State;
then, in course of time, as resignations or deaths opened
the way, <span lang="fr">Ferrand</span> secured the portfolio of the Minister of
Justice, the highest functionary after the President of the
Council!</p>

<p>From that moment, his career was one series of triumphs.
So far from throwing him back, the extraordinary adventure
of a few days before had actually added to his popularity.
Henceforth he felt persuaded he had only to steer
his bark adroitly to arrive at the very highest honours the
country could bestow.</p>

<p>On reaching his rooms, the young Minister cast a weary,
<a id="png.067" href="#png.067"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>worried look at the heap of documents, whose contents he
must master. Smiling to himself: “All that stuff,” he
said, “is marked ‘urgent,’ and for several days now a
whole pile of these documents has been lying here that
I’ve not even looked at. I wonder what really happens
in a Ministry to matters that are <em>not</em> ‘urgent’?”</p>

<p>Thereupon the Minister set feverishly to work at the
task of sorting the voluminous correspondence heaped up
in front of him. Two or three times his brow contracted,
he made a gesture of exasperation:</p>

<p>“Again!” he groaned, “again! it is really abominable!”</p>

<p>From time to time, in fact, lurking among letters and
papers, hidden under bundles of documents, <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span>
kept coming upon a little memorandum, identical in every
instance, but repeated in quite a number of copies. It was
headed: <i>The Million.</i> Its text, which never varied, was
a discreetly worded and anonymous reminder of the claim,
rather say the order, formulated by the person calling
himself <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, who called upon the Chamber to pay
the ransom fixed by himself.</p>

<p>The fourth time this happened, the Minister banged
his fist heavily on the table: “It is past endurance,” he
vociferated; “if one of my <i lang="fr">attachés</i> has ventured on this
pleasantry, the first thing I do to-morrow will be to show
my gentleman the door.”</p>

<p>But it was getting very late; to snatch a few hours’ sleep
was imperative. Within a few minutes, <span lang="fr">Ferrand</span> had put
out the light and gone to bed. With closed eyes, he was
trying to get to sleep, when, just as the pleasant drowsiness
that precedes slumber was creeping over him, the Minister
sprang half up in bed, listening intently.</p>

<p>He had heard footsteps. Then he leapt to the floor, convinced
someone was coming into the room, though he
knew he was alone, that he must be alone, in his private
suite! Too much alone, perhaps, he thought, as he remembered
that at night the Ministry was entirely deserted and
that his man slept in a separate building a long way off.
“Perhaps I have been unwise,” he reflected, but his reflections
were suddenly cut short.</p>

<p>Just as <span lang="fr">Ferrand</span>, alarmed by the noise he had heard,
was making instinctively for the electric switch at the
other end of the room, the light suddenly flashed out,
<a id="png.068" href="#png.068"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dazzling his eyes, grown accustomed to the dark. Someone
with the same intention as himself, but with greater quickness,
had anticipated him.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> gave a cry of terror. A few yards away,
a masked man stood confronting him, a grim, appalling
figure. He was wrapped in a black cloak, and carried a
cudgel in his hand.</p>

<p>“The man of last week—my assailant!” ejaculated the
Minister, turning pale.</p>

<p>Yes, before him stood the redoubtable outlaw, who, a
week before, had, with the help of mysterious confederates,
laid hands on the Minister of Justice, had kept him secluded
from his fellow men, and only restored him to liberty conditionally,
delivering, in a letter addressed to the President
of the Council, an ultimatum couched in threatening
language.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> waved a hand ordering the intruder
to leave the room, but the latter strode forward unheeding.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span>,” he proclaimed, “the hour is come to
obey me, you must <span class="prellips">decide </span><span class="ellips">...</span> you have five seconds.”</p>

<p>The unhappy Minister recoiled, utterly confounded;
unarmed, barefooted, in night attire, he felt himself at a
manifest disadvantage in face of the scoundrel confronting
him.</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> was no coward. Reckoning up his
chances of escape, he put between himself and his antagonist
the great desk littered with endless documents, and again
repeated his order:</p>

<p>“Go,” he reiterated, “go<span class="ellips">!...</span> I will have you
arrested.”</p>

<p>But the man in black broke into a sardonic laugh:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> does not take orders,” he asseverated, “it
is for <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> to issue commands. For the last time,
I repeat that I demand a million francs; give it me!”</p>

<p>“But,” protested <span lang="fr">Ferrand</span>, “where do you expect me
to get the money from? It is odious, abominable, your
effrontery is unparalleled!”</p>

<p>“Unparalleled is the word, sir; <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> has no equal—only
despicable imitators.”</p>

<p>The Minister resumed:</p>

<p>“Neither Government nor Ministers will ever consent
to obey you; <em>I</em> will never consent. Why, then,” he added
<a id="png.069" href="#png.069"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>gloomily, “we should have nothing left us but to retire
discomfited, dishonoured, the laughing-stock of France!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> advanced a step or two nearer, and in insinuating
tones:</p>

<p>“All said and done,” he hinted, “I understand your
scruples, and I quite see it is difficult for you to agree,
officially that is, under pain of risking your post. Well,
so be it; I now propose a compromise. There is the
Secret Service fund; my million will be charged on it without
scandal or publicity; you will hand me over the sum
I need; in return, I will disappear. Is it a bargain?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> was boiling with rage and indignation:</p>

<p>“Atrocious monster!” he screamed, “begone! How
have I borne to hear out your odious proposals! Be sure,
this very day the whole police force shall receive the most
stringent orders to seize you! I do not know who you
are, but no matter for that, I will punish you.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> folded his arms across his chest. Through
his black mask his eyes flashed lightning at his unfortunate
victim.</p>

<p>“So it is war?” he asked—“war to the knife? war to
the death<span class="ellips">?...</span> I bid you <span class="prellips">reflect </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Ferrand</span> made no reply. Seizing the first thing he
caught sight of on his writing-table, he grasped a silver
paper-knife in his hand, ready to sell his life dearly.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> saw the Minister was incorruptible. “Be it
death then!” he grinned his defiance.</p>

<p>With a sudden, swift movement, the brigand whirled
his cudgel round like a sling and hurled it full in the other’s
face. But the Minister ducked his head, the weapon
missed its aim and struck the wall with a dull thud.</p>

<p>“Help!” yelled <span lang="fr">Ferrand</span>, dashing for the window. But
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> barred the way, and a grim chase, pursuer and
pursued, began in <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand’s</span> chamber. The Minister,
with the energy of despair, fled before his assailant, throwing
down obstacle after obstacle in his way, oversetting
chairs, tables, every piece of furniture he could lay hands on.</p>

<p>Thus, following and fleeing, the two men made the circuit
of the room; but just as fast as the fugitive cast a stumbling-block
in the other’s way, it was cleared away and tossed
into a corner.</p>

<p>So the mad race went on. The competitors were well
<a id="png.070" href="#png.070"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>matched; no doubt one was armed, he had a revolver, but
equally without doubt, he dared not use it for fear of
making a noise. The thickness of the carpet deadened the
sound of the steps, the heavy curtains intercepted the
Minister’s frantic appeals for help.</p>

<p>But suddenly, the wretched man, running barefoot as he
was, gave a cry of pain, followed by another and another.
Next moment he staggered, fell to his knees, cried out again;
then tried to rise, but could not struggle to his feet. Blood
began to trickle from the soles of his feet, from his thighs,
his wrists, the arm on which he had fallen.</p>

<p>A last despairing groan was succeeded by utter silence,
the tortured man had fainted. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, taking advantage
of his adversary’s helplessness, had snatched up his
cudgel again, and with a yell of triumph, dealt him a
stunning blow on the head. Then, calmly walking up to his
victim without a vestige of compunction, he lifted him
bodily by the shoulders and knees and carried him to his
bed, where he laid him on his back.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Ferrand’s</span> nightshirt gaped open over the chest. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
passed the palm of his hand lightly over the damp
skin to verify the exact position of the heart that was still
beating in hurried jerks. Then, drawing from beneath his
cloak a long, fine needle, the cowardly victor plunged it
into his victim’s body below the left breast and pierced the
heart.</p>

<p>Holding a mirror to the lips, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> made doubly
sure that <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> had ceased to breathe. Yes, he
was dead, stone dead!</p>

<p>Thereupon, walking quietly over to the switch, he plunged
the room in darkness, and in the darkness vanished.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">It was now about three o’clock in the morning. The
concierge at the door of the Ministry opening on the <span lang="fr">Rue
Cambon</span> was awakened from a sound sleep by someone
tapping softly at his window.</p>

<p>“Open, please!” came the usual request, in calm,
deliberate accents.</p>

<p>In a thick voice the porter, still half asleep, asked mechanically
who it was asking to be let out.</p>

<p>After a moment’s hesitation, the answer came:</p>

<p>“An <i lang="fr">attaché</i>, special service in the Minister’s secretariat!”<!-- TN: closing quote invisible --></p>

<p><a id="png.071" href="#png.071"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The concierge drew the cord, and a second or two later
heard the door reclose.</p>

<p>He had just opened, without a thought of suspicion, for
the murderer of <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span>! As he dropped off to
sleep again, the man merely grumbled to himself:</p>

<p>“Pretty hours for working, I don’t <span class="prellips">think </span><span class="ellips">...</span> One of
them bloodsucker fellows again, I’ll be bound, who hang
about Ministers. That chap who’s just gone, no doubt
he’s been stopping on late to work so as he needn’t turn
out so early to-morrow morning.”</p>

 ><small>A WIRELESS FROM MID-ATLANTIC</small></h2>


<p class="noindent">“<span class="smc">A nail</span> ... another nail! <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>, where did
you put the others?”</p>

<p>“In the little bowl on the side-table,” replied the Chief
of the Criminal Investigation Department from where he
knelt on the carpet, while Professor Ardell, who was holding
between thumb and forefinger the nail he had just
found, stood up again, rubbing his back with his free hand.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary! most extraordinary!” muttered the
learned professor, while <span lang="fr">M. Casamajols</span>, who was also
present, questioned the doctor anxiously:</p>

<p>“Well, your diagnosis, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Egad! <span lang="fr">Monsieur le Procureur</span>, my diagnosis is perfectly
plain and simple, and equally positive, <span lang="fr">M. Désiré</span> is dead,
and he has been dead several hours now.”</p>

<p>At seven o’clock that morning, the discovery of the dead
body of the Minister of Justice lying lifeless on his bed
had thrown the personnel of the Ministry into the wildest
commotion. The domestics, well trained servants, had
immediately advised the police, and <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, hurrying
with all speed to the Ministry of Justice, had passed on
the intelligence to <span lang="fr">M. Casamajols’</span><!-- TN: original reads "Casamajol's" --> private residence and
sent an urgent summons to Professor Ardell. The three
men, when they arrived almost simultaneously at the <span lang="fr">Place
Vendôme</span>, had been forced to abandon any false hopes they
might have entertained the instant they set eyes on the
unfortunate man. <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span> was dead! For the
tenth time the professor confirmed the fact to <span lang="fr">M. Casamajols</span>, who could not believe his own eyes and ears.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, pale and haggard, intervened:</p>

<p>“Dead!” he exclaimed, “you mean murdered, do you
not, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I do mean murdered; the fact is obvious.
<span lang="fr">M. Désiré Ferrand</span>, awakened suddenly in the night, was
<a id="png.073" href="#png.073"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>struck with an instrument which evidently stunned him
without leaving any wound—perhaps one of those cudgels
murderers sometimes use.”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean,” broke in <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, “a sandbag,
a sack, that is, filled with sand; it makes the most
deadly weapon you can imagine when wielded like a sling.”</p>

<p>The professor signified his agreement with the Chief’s
version of the affair, and went on:</p>

<p>“The victim, thus incapacitated, nothing easier than to
pierce his heart with a needle; as a matter of fact, we
have discovered one driven in under the left breast of the
unfortunate man.”</p>

<p>Noting the disordered state of the room, <span lang="fr">M. Casamajols</span>
observed:</p>

<p>“Before the end there was evidently a struggle, a desperate
struggle,” and the professor agreed.</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> now broke in again:</p>

<p>“A struggle, however, that was suddenly interrupted
when the Minister, who was barefooted, stopped all of a
sudden and fell to the floor. Evidently the aggressor, in
order to handle his man more easily, and taking advantage
of a favourable opportunity, emptied a bagful of nails over
the carpet, the nails we have been picking up all this time.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right,” agreed the professor, “the little
superficial punctures we noticed scarring the dead man’s
limbs were no doubt caused by the nails scattered about
the floor.”</p>

<p>“The scoundrel! he provided for everything, it appears—left
nothing to chance.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> was profoundly agitated and perplexed.
Striding up and down the room like a caged lion, casting
furtive glances at the Minister’s body, he pondered the
tragic origins of the crime and strove to fathom the mystery
of who the criminal was.</p>

<p>At seven in the morning he had been awakened by the
telephone ringing him up from the Ministry of Justice.
Summoned in all haste to the <span lang="fr">Place Vendôme</span>, in a quarter
of an hour he was at the scene of action, questioning the
staff, examining the Minister’s bedroom, the adjoining
apartments and the precincts generally of the mansion,
but entirely, absolutely without result.</p>

<p>Subsequently, however, when he came to search among
<a id="png.074" href="#png.074"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>74<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the papers littering the Minister’s desk, he had been astonished,
as had <span lang="fr">Ferrand</span> himself, by the great number of
holograph memoranda, all relating to <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> million
francs and no doubt intentionally intermingled with the
“urgent” correspondence. It was deliberately done, it was
evidently the sign manual once more of the criminal, it
was <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, who, in ironic mood, anxious to rouse public
opinion afresh, thus affirmed his presence and confirmed
his impunity.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas?</span>—no, it could not be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! For six
months past, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> had cherished the absolute conviction
that the notorious criminal had been personated
by his subordinate, Inspector <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, of the Criminal Investigation
Department, who under pretence of relentlessly
tracking down the elusive ruffian, had carried out a whole
series of thefts and other crimes under this sinister disguise.
But <span lang="fr">Juve</span> was in prison, there was no shadow of doubt
about that. Then what was one to think?</p>

<p>As time went on and the day lengthened, corridors and
antechambers grew more and more crowded, hummed
louder and louder with excited talk—magistrates having
appointments to confer with the Chief, electors from
<span lang="fr">Ferrand’s</span> constituency come to see their member, officials
and <span lang="fr">employés</span> coming and going unceasingly; outside the
very door of the death chamber eager voices were raised
in discussion and dispute, regrets for the past mingled with
hopes for the future.</p>

<p>So far, however, the tidings of <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand’s</span> death
had hardly spread beyond official circles. The <span lang="fr">Elysée</span>,
the Ministries, were aware of the tragedy, the public knew
little or nothing. But this was not to last long. Suddenly
a swarm of newsboys, crying special editions, burst with
strident shouts into the <span lang="fr">Place Vendôme</span>, debouching from
the <span lang="fr">Rue de la Paix</span>, deploying under the windows of the
Ministry, then tearing off like a whirlwind towards the
<span lang="fr">Tuileries</span>, red and breathless, their papers selling like hot
cakes at a premium. The special edition of <cite lang="fr">La Capitale</cite>
penetrated to the private apartments of the Ministry,
and <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, impatient to know in what terms the tragic
story was told and to read the criticisms on the police with
which the Press was evidently supplementing the narrative
of the murder, secured a copy of the paper. Looking over
<a id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>75<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his shoulder, <span lang="fr">M. Casamajols</span> read in huge capitals, immediately
below the name of the journal:</p>

<p>“<i>Assassination of the Minister of Justice.</i>”</p>

<p>Below this again, figured the cryptic headline:</p>

<p>“<i>Will he arrest <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?</i>”</p>

<p>“That question, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>,” slyly suggested <span lang="fr">M. Casamajols</span>,
“is probably addressed to you.” The head of the
Criminal Investigation Department made no reply, but
with pursed lips, ran his eye rapidly over the detailed
account of <span lang="fr">Ferrand’s</span> death, though without learning anything
he did not know already, and then went on to the
article he believed, like <span lang="fr">M. Casamajols</span>, to specially concern
himself. But as he read on, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> was lost in deeper
and deeper wonderment. The article in question ran as
follows:</p>

<p>“<i>From mid-Atlantic, from aboard the liner ‘<cite lang="fr">La Lorraine</cite>’
which sailed the day before yesterday from New York,
bound for <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span>, comes the information by wireless that
the American detective, Tom Bob, a passenger on the vessel
in question, strongly and justly moved by the daring acts
of violence committed of late in Paris, has announced his
intention to devote all his time and all his energy, from the
first moment of his arrival in Europe, to the discovery and
arrest of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.</i>”</p>

<p>The writer concluded the article with the words: “<i>Let
us wish Tom Bob every good luck, but will he arrest
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?</i>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> and <span lang="fr">M. Casamajols</span> looked at each other
completely at a loss.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose it is serious, this story?” asked the
latter; “surely it must be a newspaper <i class="prellips" lang="fr">canard </i><span class="ellips">...</span> very
American, too <span class="prellips">American </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I don’t believe it, do you?”</p>

<p>“Egad!” confessed <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, very much put out,
“I am bound to allow that this Tom Bob exists, and
even that he enjoys a certain reputation in the New York
police force, but then, to advertise himself like that, really!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Casamajols</span> suggested with a smile of irony:</p>

<p>“Eh, <span lang="fr">Havard</span>, suppose Tom Bob <em>did</em> run down and arrest
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?”</p>

<p>Lifting his hands to heaven, the Chief of the Investigation
Department turned his back on the Procureur Général:</p>

<p>“God Almighty!” he swore, “hadn’t we enough to worry
<a id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>us, enough to make us look ridiculous, without this Tom
Bob shoving his finger in the pie. Upon my word, it’s
the last straw, that<span class="ellipsp">!...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Havard</span> stopped dead in the middle of his tirade; the
door of the room had opened.</p>

<p>“Do you mean me by that, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>?” demanded
the newcomer.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> curbed a gesture of annoyance; decidedly
he was in Fortune’s bad books that day. He drew back,
and bowing low to the President of the Council—it was
no other than <span lang="fr">M. Monnier</span> himself who asked the question.</p>

<p>“I do assure you, sir,” he replied respectfully, “I should
never allow myself to think such a thing of you.”</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smc">Get</span> along then that’s no way to treat people! What’s
he want with me, anyway, the nasty fellow?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span> was furious; turning sharply round, she
thus apostrophized an individual who had just signalized
his presence by tickling her ribs more roughly than agreeably.
It was a Monday, and about two o’clock in the
afternoon. <span lang="fr">Nini</span> had just issued from the <span lang="fr">Poissonnière</span>
Gate; mounting the bank overhanging the moat of the fortifications
and turning to the left, she was making for
<span lang="fr">Saint-Ouen</span>. The young woman stared suspiciously at the
man who was following her without a word, good, bad or
indifferent, a smile of doubtful import on his face.</p>

<p>Presently, reassured more or less by her examination of
the stranger, <span lang="fr">Nini</span> added:</p>

<p>“I thought it was the ‘cops’.”</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders. “D’you think I belong
to the police? do I look like it?”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” <span lang="fr">Nini</span> admitted; “but come, let’s have
a peep at your phiz; what does this here masquerading
mean, eh?”</p>

<p>Obeying the young woman’s demand, the other turned
his face towards her; the cheeks were muffled in a great
yellow silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>“That’s along of my dominoes,” he said; “I’ve had toothache
for the last three days.”</p>

<p>“Well, what then?” pursued <span lang="fr">Nini</span>.</p>

<p>“Why, I’m in funds to-day, especially as how it’s Monday,
and I’m going on the <span class="prellips">spree </span><span class="ellips">...</span> suppose we make the
bust together, eh?”</p>

<p>Superciliously, <span lang="fr">Nini</span> looked her interlocutor up and down.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing to-day,” she told him, “I’ve got my
man.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p><a id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“You’re mighty curious, ain’t you? still, as the gentleman
wants to know, we’ve arranged to meet at the <cite>Blue
Chestnut</cite>—that’s plain and simple enough, what?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” the other agreed, “but as it happens, I’m
going there, too.”</p>

<p>“Then, march on in front,” ordered the girl, “and I’ll
stick behind; I don’t care to look as if I were making up
to chaps about these parts.”</p>

<p>The man was all docility and obeyed instantly; walking
a few steps ahead of the young harlot, but every now and
then casting a furtive glance over his shoulder to make
sure the girl was following on the same road as himself, he
stumped off in the direction of the <cite>Blue Chestnut</cite>, seeming
very well pleased with the beginning he had so far made.
With a quick movement he swept the hair lower on his
forehead and pulled out his handkerchief he had wrapped
round his jaws under pretence of protecting his aching
teeth against the cold.</p>

<p>“So much to the good,” he thought to himself; “she’s
never recognized me—and I have good hopes it’ll be the
same with the others.”</p>

<p>Who was this mysterious person who had made bold to
squeeze <span lang="fr">Mlle. Nini’s</span> waist as she was peaceably leaving
the city by the <span lang="fr">Porte de Poissonnière</span>? It was no other in
actual fact than <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>!</p>

<p>For some days past the young journalist had been leading
an absolutely appalling existence. Events had followed
quick on each other’s heels, each more disconcerting, more
overwhelming than the other. Chance and mischance had
thrown him into adventures that grew more and more
baffling, and seemed to him to leave no loophole for escape.</p>

<p>First his meeting with <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>, then his connection
with old <span lang="fr">Moche</span>—a tricky scamp he felt he could
not trust—then after being unjustly accused by <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>,
he had been odiously victimized through <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> vile
machinations, bringing him under the strongest suspicion
of having caused the death of three policemen. And all
this, just a few hours after Parliament had acclaimed him
one of the authors of the violent attack on the Minister
of Justice.</p>

<p>Escaped by a miracle from the clutches of the police, the
journalist had ever since the tragic night in <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span>
<a id="png.079" href="#png.079"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>garret led an insufferable existence, hardly daring to go
out at all, and then only at night in the most out-of-the-way
districts, spending whole days hiding in slums, concealed
in rag-pickers’ hovels, in constant terror of being
caught. And now, to put the coping-stone on his misery
had come the assassination of <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span>, a mystery
still unsolved, a crime without doubt the work of
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, thought <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, but which no less surely would
rouse the Criminal Investigation Department to renewed
exertions, and render his continued evasion more than ever
precarious.</p>

<p>Yet <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was full of courage; he must not give in,
it was all important he should remain at liberty, for the
journalist was now firmly convinced that he was embarked
on the right track, and that it would not be long now before
he would unmask <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> accomplices, perhaps <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
himself into the bargain. Luck, good luck, had in
fact brought him in touch with a crew of shady individuals,
the instruments and intermediaries of old <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span> nefarious
schemes. Now these folks made no concealment amongst
themselves of the fact that they were in the habit of receiving
orders anonymous but peremptory about the
source of which, however, they did not trouble their heads;
they served and were glad to serve as <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> lieutenants,
they were in the pay of that notorious brigand. To trace
back events to their source would be the surest way to
discover the head that set all these arms in motion.</p>

<p>“I’m going to the <cite>Blue Chestnut</cite>,” <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span> had
told him—and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had boldly replied that at that very
moment he, too, was on his way to spend the afternoon
at that notorious resort of the Paris criminal world. In
fact the discovery that <span lang="fr">Paulet’s</span> mistress was bound for the
<cite>Blue Chestnut</cite>—a suburban semi-rural resort just outside
the fortifications, and a favourite <i lang="fr">rendezvous</i> with crooks
and demireps of all descriptions—to meet “her man” had
given the journalist a lively glow of satisfaction. Days ago
he had come to the resolution of shadowing the young
street-walker, getting to know her comings and goings,
and so through her getting into close touch with the band
of her nefarious associates.</p>

<p>And lo! in a moment his hopes were to be realised.
<span lang="fr">Nini</span> was going to the very spot where all these good, or
<a id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>rather bad, people would be gathered. Decidedly <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span>
lucky star was in the ascendant, he was to enjoy the priceless
advantage of meeting and making closer acquaintance
with that questionable character, the mysterious apache
<span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, whom the journalist already suspected, not without
good reason, perhaps, of having murdered the bank
messenger.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was feeling no small satisfaction at the
success of his make-up, which had proved so admirable
a disguise. <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, of course, knew him quite well,
she had seen him only a few days before, he was one of
the gang and the reputed murderer of the police officers,
if not perhaps of the Minister himself. His face and personality
<em>could</em> not have faded from the girl’s memory. Yet
for five minutes he had been talking with her, and she had
not recognized him!</p>

<p>“All goes well,” the journalist congratulated himself, as
he made his way into the garden of the <cite>Blue Chestnut</cite>.
Yes, he was certainly in luck. The place that Monday
afternoon was crowded with customers, a large number
seated about the scattered tables, each of which with its
load of wine-bottles formed the nucleus of a group of laughing,
chattering men and girls.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> took his seat unobtrusively at the foot of a
table, endeavoring to pass unnoticed while he consumed
a modest half-pint and listened to his neighbour’s conversation.
He was just asking himself how he could best join
in the talk himself when circumstances afforded him the
opportunity.</p>

<p>A wave of excitement swept the garden from end to end.
A gay companion, a musician with an old guitar under his
arm, had just appeared, a man <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> knew of old. It
was one <span lang="fr">Bougille</span>, the vagabond <span lang="fr">Bougille</span>, the man with the
shaggy beard and merry-andrew face, <span lang="fr">Bougille</span> the honest
tramp, the incorrigible wanderer. The old fellow was well
known and well loved at the <cite>Blue Chestnut</cite>, where on fête
days he would often come to reap the reward in small
change of his talents as a music-maker.</p>

<p>“A dance, a dance! the <i lang="fr">Sonneuse</i>!” the company demanded
with one voice, while all eyes turned in the direction
of “The Beadle” and all hands pointed to “Big Ernestine.”</p>

<p>Slowly, hands in pockets, with an affected air and a
<a id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>look of satisfaction, which he tried to hide, the man
addressed the crowd:</p>

<p>“So, it’s us you want to get <span class="prellips">at </span><span class="ellips">...</span> must have us
dance it you again, eh<span class="ellips">?...</span> well, well, off we go.”</p>

<p>Cigarette stuck between his lips, cap cocked over one
ear, the apache gripped Ernestine by the nape of the neck,
whirled the girl round, and round again, to bring her facing
him, then ordered her roughly:</p>

<p>“Go ahead, wench; give it ’em, I say!”</p>

<p>At this <span lang="fr">Bougille</span> struck up the tune, and the couple began
their evolutions.</p>

<p>At first it was a slow waltz, with no precise rhythm, but
dubious attitudes, languishing poses, embraces suggestive
of passionate abandonment. Then, with a sudden brutality,
the man hurled his partner away from him, caught her by
the shoulders, threw her to the ground, then passing his
arm under her supple waist, raised her to her feet, then
lifted her up against his breast; then, three times in succession,
while “Big Ernestine” lay passive, “The Beadle,”
striking an attitude half Hercules, half acrobat, whirled
the woman about in his arms and beat her head on the
earth.</p>

<p>A thunder of applause broke out on every side. For
sure there was not another pair to match “The Beadle”
and “Big Ernestine” at dancing the <i lang="fr">Sonneuse</i>. And what
a dance it was, where the cavalier had to mimic the act
of breaking his partner’s skull against the ground as apaches
beat to death peaceable citizens against the curb of the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>It was fine, it was magnificent, the crowd was thrilled,
electrified, and a young blackguard, “Beauty Boy” by
nickname, caught by the wave of hot enthusiasm that
stirred the passions of them all, seized the opportunity to
give a bite at the nape of <span lang="fr">Nini’s</span> neck, who cuffed him
soundly for his pains.</p>

<p>“Look where you’re going, you idiot!” roared a furious
voice as “Beauty Boy” fell foul of a shabby individual
in his flight to escape the offended <span lang="fr">Nini’s</span> vengeance. It
was no other than <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>. What could the old fellow
be doing there? He was dirtier, shabbier, and more bent
than ever; at sight of him, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was filled with alarm,
but at the same time it struck him that <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span> presence
<a id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>might prove useful to him. Yes, undoubtedly, it was a
piece of good luck to find the old man had come to the
<cite>Blue Chestnut</cite>. Assuredly, under pretext of dancing and
amusing themselves, the band must have gathered there
to receive their secret instructions from the chief, who
doubtless was no other than <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. The moment
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> set eyes on <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, he told himself: “Ha,
ha! ’twon’t be long now before a something fresh turns
up!”</p>

<p>Meantime the journalist took good care not to show
himself to the dubious individual in whose service he had
been engaged for twenty-four hours. He had far from
pleasant recollections of his stay at <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span>, and it might
well be the latter was equally out of conceit with him;
quite possibly the old advocate believed it was he had
killed the police officers, very possibly again, by way of
ingratiating himself with the force, he might not hesitate
to deliver up the supposed murderer into their clutches,
should opportunity offer.</p>

<p>At the same time the young man slipped surreptitiously
behind <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, while the latter was in talk with the “Beauty
Boy.” He overheard all they said:</p>

<p>“Lend me a yellow boy,” the young apache was asking
his companion; “it’s not just for larks, I tell you, it’s
for biz.”</p>

<p>“Why, what are you up to, eh?” the other asked in
his turn.</p>

<p>“Beauty Boy” explained: “To-morrow’s Monday, ain’t
it? Well, Tuesday’s the day the swell Trans-Atlantic
reaches <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span> with all the rich American travellers aboard;
so I’m going to make my little collection, as usual—you
know my game, eh, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>?”</p>

<p>“Gad! no, not over well,” declared the old scamp, doubtless
with the idea of extracting a more definite account of
the other’s plans.</p>

<p>“But it’s as plain as plain,” retorted the apache. “Day
before the boat comes in, I hook it to <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span>, dressed up
to the nines; then I slip into the special train where the
swagger dames are, then on the journey up I get to work;
it’s mostly purses I do, now and then a ring, a bit of
jewelry, or pocket-book. All that lot, when they step
ashore, are upset, bewildered, sick, tired, <em>they</em> never care
<a id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>83<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to kick up a dust if they happen to find their pockets have
been gone through.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>“Not bad,” he laughed, “not bad! You’re a cute chap,
my boy, for all your silly looks and dandified airs.”</p>

<p>“Only,” pursued the apache, “one must anyway have
one’s return ticket, and as it happens, I’m cleaned out just
now.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” muttered the old miser.</p>

<p>But “Beauty Boy” returned to his charge:</p>

<p>“Come now, don’t be a mean cuss, hand me over four
bulls, won’t you?”</p>

<p>At last <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> so far yielded to the other’s eager
importunities and forked out. But, like a good business
man, he struck a bargain with the borrower that the latter,
on his return, that is to say on the next day but one,
should pay him back thirty francs.</p>

<p>The cash once in his pocket, the apache vanished.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had overheard it all, besides catching other scraps
of conversation from one and another of the band, from
which he gathered only one thing clearly, and that was
that at bottom everyone of them was upset about the
arrival of the redoubtable and mysterious Tom Bob, whose
coming was announced with such a flourish of trumpets and
noisy advertisement—a proceeding by-the-by he, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>,
deemed highly injudicious.</p>

<p>The journalist noted the “Beauty Boy’s” departure, and
he could not help thinking that it would be greatly to
<em>his</em> advantage, too, if only he could get to <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span>. But
alas! he had not a sou and could not borrow from <span lang="fr">Père
Moche</span>, as the apache had done, inasmuch as he could not
very well urge the same reasons to justify the loan. Still
the idea tormented him that he <em>must</em> go to <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span>. It was
all important for him to get to know Tom Bob at the
earliest possible moment, so to say before everybody else.
He was still cudgelling his brains to discover some way
of realizing his project when suddenly he shuddered to
hear a hoarse, angry voice growling in his ear:</p>

<p>“Scoundrel, brigand, murderer, aren’t you ashamed to
show your face? why don’t I have you run in on the spot?
will you rid me of the sight of you, now, this instant, you
hell-hound of calamity!”</p>

<p><a id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>84<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> wheeled round in consternation, dumbfounded
by this avalanche of abuse, this maelstrom of words. His
eyes opened wide in amazement; it was old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> who was
addressing him in these furious terms—<span lang="fr">Moche</span>, his face
working with passion, unable to contain himself for anger.</p>

<p>The old scoundrel went on with a hypocritical assumption
of righteous indignation.</p>

<p>“When I think how I befriended you, how I saved you
in your extremity, and then you came and murdered people
in my house and committed atrocious crimes, I don’t know,
I really do not know, you villain, what hinders <span class="prellips">me </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> looked his man calmly in the face. For one
moment he had entertained the notion of seizing his accuser
by the throat and choking him, for instinctively his
gorge rose at the outrageous charge brought against him.
But he quickly realized that, to begin with, old <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span>
indignation was only pretence, and then, that the least
display of violence on his part could only have consequences
disastrous to his plans. The journalist had gathered
the firm conviction in the course of the two hours he
had spent among the dubious frequenters of the <cite>Blue Chestnut</cite>
that <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> was possessed of a strange, but indubitable
authority over these sinister personages. There
was no question that, for some purpose or another, he was
in the habit of aiding and abetting them, lending them
money at need, or that he possessed an astuteness that made
him master of the rest of his associates—and was perhaps
the mysterious intermediary who transmitted to them the
orders of the elusive autocrat <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.</p>

<p>Postponing all thought of reprisals for the present, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
obeyed the old ruffian’s orders and sneaked away; a few
moments more and he quitted the <cite>Blue Chestnut</cite> without
his departure being remarked by anyone whatsoever, not
even by the landlord, who troubled himself very little
about his customer going away, as he invariably observed
the excellent custom of making everybody pay in advance.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">“That’s it, that must be the train!” Issuing from the
<span lang="fr">Saint-Lazare</span> terminus, an engine, heralded by the glare of
its two head-lights, plunged beneath the dark arch of
the <span lang="fr">Batignolles</span> tunnel. Enveloped in a dense cloud of
smoke, the locomotive rolled slowly on, with a rhythmical
<a id="png.085" href="#png.085"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>roar and rattle, towing behind it a long line of passenger
coaches.</p>

<p>His feet in the thick mud, his back against the clammy
stonework, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> stood motionless half way through the
tunnel waiting till the train reached him.</p>

<p>The journalist, on leaving the <cite>Blue Chestnut</cite>, left alone
with his thoughts, and now firmly convinced he had at
last come upon the gang among whom he must look to
find not only the murderer of the bank collector, but likewise
the authors of the attack on the Minister of Justice,
and to boot, in all likelihood, the assassin of <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span>,
told himself it was above all things incumbent on him
from this time on to dare any and every risk to secure
a collaborator in his task. His mind was made up; it
was Tom Bob must be his ally and fellow-worker.</p>

<p>Who and what was this Tom Bob? he did not rightly
know. Two or three times at most he had heard his friend
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> speak of the man. <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, this much was certain,
admired the American—albeit they were not personally
known to one another—as a clever, capable officer, full of
modern ideas. <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> pictured Tom Bob as being in fact
a sort of <span lang="fr">Juve</span> of the New World—with this difference,
that the one seemed as fond of self-advertisement and popular
applause as the other was an admirer of modesty and
reticence.</p>

<p>Summing up the situation <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> told himself:</p>

<p>“It is impossible, at the present moment, to show
myself at the headquarters of the Criminal Department;
in their stupid way they would simply arrest me without
listening to my story, or even arrest me after they had
heard it, if only by way of throwing a sop to public opinion.
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> himself is in gaol; the unfortunate man can do
nothing to help me. Rather is it for me to save him, and
to have the power I must be free. It may be Tom Bob
will not be sorry to have me as a discreet and anonymous
fellow-worker. Let us go find Tom Bob!”</p>

<p>This decision taken, the question was to carry it into
effect. Now <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, at eight o’clock in the evening, had
still less money in his possession than at four o’clock of
the afternoon. But the journalist, having noted the time
of the last train that would take him to <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span> before the
arrival of the American packet, viz., the nine forty-five
<a id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>slow train, had thought to himself that, if it was impossible
for him to travel without a ticket, it was perhaps
easy enough to jump the train as it went by, and so be
carried to his destination—on condition, of course, of not
attracting attention by entering a compartment, but instead
riding unobtrusively on a step, or on some buffer or other,
or else lying at full length on the roof of a carriage.</p>

<p>He had explored the neighbourhood of the station and
made out that by way of the <span lang="fr">Rue de Rome</span> and utilizing
a scaffolding erected by the workmen engaged in enlarging
the tunnel, he could easily in the evening dusk climb down
the scaffold poles on to the line. But on second thought
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had conceived a much simpler plan. At nine
twenty for four sous he purchased a ticket for <span lang="fr">Batignolles</span>
and made his way on to the platform, then seizing his
opportunity when nobody was looking, he stepped on to the
permanent way and so, keeping along the confining walls,
reached the entrance of the tunnel and waited there for
the passing of the <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span> train.</p>

<p>He had set his watch by the station clock, and the train
being due to start at forty-three minutes past the hour,
he was at his post in the tunnel at half a minute before
that time. He arched his back against the wall, and in
spite of the blinding smoke, watched the line of vehicles
as they moved slowly past him.</p>

<p>“Engine, luggage van, another van, several third class
coaches, a corridor carriage, a first, a <span class="prellips">second </span><span class="ellips">...</span> now’s
my time!”</p>

<p>The young man sprang on the next coach that came
opposite him, it was a risky job, a false step and he would
be thrown on to the rails, under the wheels, but the
journalist had audacity and fearlessness on his side, and
dexterity into the bargain, and he landed safely. In a
few seconds, by help of the hand-holds running along the
sides and the mouldings of the woodwork, which luckily
projected outwards, he succeeded in first hoisting himself
between two carriages and then climbing on to the roof of
one of them. He stretched himself flat on his face and
threw his arms round the projecting top of a lamp, then
with legs wide to help maintain his equilibrium, he lay
perfectly still.</p>

<p>Hardly was he in position before the train quickened its
<a id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>87<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pace and emerged from the tunnel. The journalist breathed
the purer air with infinite gusto. But his satisfaction was
of short duration; the engine now began to emit showers
of sparks and clouds of greasy, blinding smoke. He could
only shut his eyes tight and wait in stoical patience.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” the young fellow said to himself, “it’s merely a
bad night to get through! I shall be a bit cold perhaps,
and a bit dirty, but the great point is, I shall get there.
<span lang="fr">Hâvre</span> is not so far away as they make out; I think we
must already be getting near the bridge of <span lang="fr">Asnières</span>, for the
train, I see, is beginning to slow down, as they always do.”</p>

<p>But next moment he let fly a big oath. The train, contrary
to all precedent, was taking a big curve, the rails
were steeply inclined inwards and the carriages tilted over
in the same direction, so that <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, who was not expecting
it, very nearly slipped off his perch. He would infallibly
have tumbled off if he had not made a wild clutch at the
top of his lamp. The brakes were applied sharply and a
jar ran from carriage to carriage; then the train stopped
dead.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> opened his eyes and looked about him. He was
in the middle of a vast shed; on either side he saw the roofs
of carriages stretching away into infinity. For a moment
he was at a loss what to think, then the truth burst upon
him.</p>

<p>“Damnation!” he cried, “was it worth my while to lay
my plans so carefully, and make such a monstrous mistake
after all!”</p>

<p>Instead of taking the train for <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span>, he had got on to
a line of empty coaches which a yard-engine was simply
hauling out to its siding for the night.</p>

<p>Even as he realized the fact, in the distance, full steam
ahead and brilliantly lighted up, he saw a main line train
go by—the <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span> train without a doubt!</p>

 ><small>TOM BOB ON THE SPOT</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">The</span> <cite lang="fr">Lorraine</cite> had just entered the port of <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span> after an
excellent passage across the Atlantic. As usual, her passenger
list was a full one, and bore many names well known
in the worlds of high finance and fashion. The decks
were crowded with pretty women in brilliant toilettes and
clean-shaven, keen-faced men in check cloth caps, a typically
American company, not to mention a minority of
other nationalities—Frenchmen, Englishmen, heavily built
Germans, with a sprinkling of Spaniards and Italians and
even a half-dozen bronzed Asiatics, a cosmopolitan assemblage.</p>

<p>The great ship lay alongside the huge customs shed, at
the further side of which was drawn up the special boat-train
destined to convey the liner’s first class passengers to
Paris, and only waiting the latter’s release from the formalities
of the <i lang="fr">douane</i>. Now all was ready, and the heavy
train got into motion, threaded its way at a snail’s pace
through the vast labyrinth of docks and warehouses, made
a brief halt at the <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span> railway station to pick up a few
travellers having special permission to avail themselves of
this express service, then little by little gathering speed,
began the headlong race that was only to end 300 kilometres
from the start at the <span lang="fr">Gare Saint-Lazare</span> in the very heart
of the capital.</p>

<p>Very soon <i lang="fr">déjeuner</i> was served in the dining coach.</p>

<p>“How pretty the country is,” said Mrs. Silas K. Bigelow,
enthusiastically; she was a young and charming American,
who sat with eyes never leaving the window, gazing with
admiring curiosity at the fertile plains of Normandy whirling
past. Her <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> at her table in the dining car, Mr. Van Buren, one of the most famous of New York’s multi-millionaires,
less enamoured of landscape than his poetical
fellow-countrywoman, insisted on his companion devoting
a less perfunctory attention to the meal.</p>

<p><a id="png.089" href="#png.089"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>89<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The wine steward approached: “What wine will the
ladies and gentlemen drink—<span lang="fr">Saint Emilion, Pommard</span>,
extra dry?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bigelow’s neighbour, a superb creature, with hair
as black as ink and eyes of an opalescent green, shook her
head in reply to the enquiring glance of her companion, a
young Englishman, with smooth cheeks and close-cropped
hair.</p>

<p>“No, my dear Ascott,” she declared, “now we are ashore
again, I want no more of those heady beverages. All very
well at sea, but not good for my health now. Order me
some mineral water, will you?”</p>

<p>Ascott looked round in search of the wine steward, but
the man was already at the opposite end of the car, booking
the orders of the other tables.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Princess,” the young Englishman excused himself;
“directly the man comes back, I will give him your
order. Is there any particular kind you prefer?”</p>

<p>But the Princess Sonia Danidoff answered the question
only with a careless wave of the hand and a brief:</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know; I hate having to choose.”</p>

<p>Then turning with a gracious smile towards another
traveller seated at a neighbouring table, the princess
thanked him for the slight service he had rendered her by
passing her the menu card with a very polite bow.</p>

<p>Meantime Mr. Bigelow, seated not far from his wife,
uttered a startled exclamation. He had just unfolded a
French journal and rapidly cast his eye over it; indeed a
number of the passengers in the restaurant car were
similarly engaged, eagerly scanning the news columns of
the morning papers.</p>

<p>No doubt during the voyage the news sheet that appeared
on board every morning had contained sundry
important items of information supplied by wireless, but
detailed particulars were lacking, and for this reason it was
a boon to the newly-arrived travellers to be put in possession
of numberless piquant details of international events,
and especially of the activities of the fashionable world of
Paris, in which they were more particularly interested.</p>

<p>During the six days’ sea voyage, the world had not stood
still; the usual incidents, the usual joys and sorrows, the
usual anecdotes formed the staple of the record—and the
<a id="png.090" href="#png.090"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>usual crimes. But here was something of direst import;
these tourists who for nearly a week had been more or
less isolated on the high seas were startled to learn that
on arrival they were to find Paris a prey to the most acute
alarm, and that since leaving land a series of tragedies had
occurred, the most mysterious and the most terrifying ever
known. The newspapers of every shade of politics, of every
sort and kind, were full of the dramatic incidents that so
excited public opinion, and above all abounded in the latest
particulars of the daring and dastardly assassination of the
Minister of Justice that had happened a few days before.</p>

<p>But there was one item that more than any other roused
the keenest curiosity among the occupants of the restaurant
car. This was the announcement of the expected arrival
in France of the American, Tom Bob, and the statement
that the detective in question was on board the SS. <cite lang="fr">Lorraine</cite>,
due to reach <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span> on the very morning of issue. This was
naturally a highly exciting piece of news to the passengers
who had travelled with him, many of whom, moreover,
knew of the reputation the man enjoyed at police headquarters
in New York.</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” laughed the Princess Sonia Danidoff,
to whom her cavalier had just read the paragraph, “is it
possible we have had Tom Bob with us on board?”</p>

<p>“But why not, Princess,” replied the multi-millionaire.
“Surely Tom Bob might be aboard without the world being
turned upside down or the <cite lang="fr">Lorraine</cite> dressing ship in his
honour.”</p>

<p>“But is it not strange,” Mrs. Bigelow asked the question,
“that he never made himself known to us?”</p>

<p>“A detective,” observed Ascott, “is hardly likely to have
his coming announced by ambassadors, and as a rule prefers
his presence to be unremarked.”</p>

<p>The same traveller who a minute or two before had
courteously passed the list enumerating all the various sorts
of mineral waters to the Princess Danidoff now joined in
with a word of approval of Ascott’s remark:</p>

<p>“The gentleman,” he declared, “is perfectly right, and I
entirely agree with him in thinking that a detective, were
it Tom Bob himself, is bound under certain circumstances
to keep the secret of his identity. In other cases, however,
it is best he should make himself known, and that explains
<a id="png.091" href="#png.091"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>91<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>why Tom Bob, without therefore laying himself open to a
charge of inconsistency, has chosen on the one hand to
preserve an incognito on board ship while on the other informing
the French press by wireless of his speedy arrival
in Paris.”</p>

<p>All eyes were turned on the speaker, who was evidently
one of the <cite lang="fr">Lorraine’s</cite> passengers. He was a man of about
forty, whose brick-red complexion was the more noticeable
as his hair was deeply tinged with silver. Like many Americans,
he carried at his buttonhole a miniature U.S.A. flag
in enamelled porcelain; two heavy gold rings adorned his
finger, and he wore coat and trousers of light grey cloth.
The inspection continued for some seconds after its object
had quietly resumed his meal, for none of the first class
passengers could recollect having ever seen this particular
individual during the passage over.</p>

<p>At this moment a Frenchman who sat facing him, quite a
young man, who had joined the train at <span lang="fr">Hâvre</span>, addressed
the stranger:</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir, but they say Tom Bob proposes to take
measures in this country to arrest <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, that elusive
brigand who always baffles the best efforts of the
<span class="prellips">police </span><span class="ellips">...</span> it is a bold venture!”</p>

<p>The man of the silvery locks looked up at the youth, then
fixing his eyes on the other’s face, answered calmly after
a pause:</p>

<p>“It is very American, sir; what need to say more?”</p>

<p>“Well said, sir,” exclaimed a stout, ruddy-faced man,
known to all on the ship as being Hamilton Gould, an enormously
wealthy Californian, who had been round the world
three or four times already, “in America we are all like that.”</p>

<p>Mr. Van Buren smiled, but said nothing, while Mrs. Bigelow, entering into the spirit of the conversation, suggested:</p>

<p>“Perhaps Tom Bob was just one of the bar tenders or
maybe that old lady with the white wig who by her own
account travels for a Paris dressmaker.”</p>

<p>The Princess Danidoff added yet another guess with a
glance of irony at the last speaker:</p>

<p>“Or the Captain<span class="ellips">?...</span> why, not, while you are about it,
dear Mrs. Bigelow?”</p>

<p>Presently cigars were lighted and the majority of the
<a id="png.092" href="#png.092"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ladies left the restaurant car to return to their several compartments.
Ascott, Van Buren and Hamilton Gould, however,
had followed Mrs. Bigelow and the Princess Danidoff
as they left the carriage, while behind them the man with
the silvery hair had risen from his seat. The conversation
was resumed in the corridor. A window stood open, and
Mr. Van Buren begged permission to smoke a cigarette.
Then observing that Sonia Danidoff was about to do the
like:</p>

<p>“May I give you a light?” he asked the princess, who
thanked him for the offer.</p>

<p>“Egad!” exclaimed the millionaire next moment, “what
a nuisance! I thought I had my lighter in my vest pocket,
and now I can’t find it; I must have left it in my portmanteau.”</p>

<p>A bantering voice was heard behind him:</p>

<p>“Or rather, haven’t you perhaps had it stolen, sir?”</p>

<p>Van Buren wheeled round; it was the man with the
silvery hair who had spoken. Without appearing to pay
any heed to the astonishment he provoked, the man went
on:</p>

<p>“You must know that these <i lang="fr">trains de luxe</i>, such as the
one we are in, are often worked by pickpockets, and that
these gentry find a malicious satisfaction in robbing passengers
even of articles of little value, simply with the
object of keeping their hand in.”</p>

<p>Van Buren did not know what to say, Mrs. Bigelow
smiled nervously, while not without a touch of anxiety, the
Princess Sonia Danidoff, whose lips were trembling a little,
murmured with a forced laugh:</p>

<p>“Pooh! we ought not to be afraid, surely, seeing the
renowned Tom Bob is with <span class="prellips">us </span><span class="ellips">...</span> but is he really with
us?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes!” cried Hamilton Gould. “I’m ready to
wager he is.”</p>

<p>“Will you show us the man?” demanded Mrs. Bigelow.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may, who knows?”</p>

<p>Then all burst out laughing; Ascott had just drawn
their attention to the smoking compartment at the far end of
the car, where a passenger lay fast asleep, adding the
suggestion:</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s that gentleman.”</p>

<p><a id="png.093" href="#png.093"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>93<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>First the men, then the ladies, all equally amused and
curious, stole one by one to peep in at the traveller who
was still fast asleep, little dreaming of the interest he
aroused.</p>

<p>But the man of the silvery hair again drew attention to
himself by his criticism of Ascott’s identification.</p>

<p>“It shows a want of perspicacity, sir,” he declared, “to
take the gentleman sleeping there for Tom Bob. In the
first place a detective does not sleep; besides which, one
has only to look at your man in the smoking carriage to
be quite sure, first, that he is a Frenchman; that is plain
from the cut of his clothes, and second, that he is an officer,
in fact I should say an officer actually serving with the
colours.”</p>

<p>Much impressed, Sonia Danidoff drew nearer to the
speaker: “And what tells you that, sir?”
The man bowed gravely.</p>

<p>“Nothing simpler, madam! To begin with, look at
that bundle of sticks and umbrellas in the net above his
head; amongst them don’t you see something long in a
green baize case?—a sword, an officer’s sword, obviously!
Then notice his temples; the hair lies flat to the head all
round a circular line, while it sticks out like other people’s
just below at the level of the top of the ear—that means
our gentleman usually wears a képi. Then, consider, apart
from the moustache, the only hair he wears on his face, the
bronze of the skin, stopping short at the neck—there you
have a man used to living in the open air. I believe I am
pretty accurate in my <span class="prellips">diagnosis </span><span class="ellips">...</span> what do you think
of it?”</p>

<p>Hamilton Gould’s big hand fell familiarly on the silver-haired
individual’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I think, sir,” he declared emphatically, “that to follow
up a train of reasoning like that, to draw a conclusion
with such clearness and precision, there’s only one man in
all the world, above all only one American—and I think
you are that man, Tom Bob in person!”</p>

<p>The man addressed smiled as he looked with sparkling
eyes in the face of the genial globe-trotter.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said simply, “I am Tom Bob.”</p>

<p>It was the signal for an outburst of enthusiasm and curiosity
that soon spread to every passenger in the carriage.
<a id="png.094" href="#png.094"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>All crowded round the famous detective, each more eager
than the other to speak to the great man.</p>

<p>“I beg and pray,” Mrs. Bigelow urged her husband,
“you will introduce me; how delightful, how amusing to
know a detective!”</p>

<p>But already Tom Bob, like the perfect man of the world
he was, was paying his respects to the Princess Danidoff.</p>

<p>“We possess some good friends in common, Princess,”
he was saying, “the Count and Countess Karenisky; I knew
them well when I was staying at St. Petersburg; in fact, I
had an opportunity of doing them a small service.”</p>

<p>“At the time of the Nihilists, was it not?” interrupted
the Princess Sonia.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, during that critical <span class="prellips">period </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But the princess shuddered at the mournful recollections
the words recalled, and stopped any further reference to
the past: “Do not, I beg you, sir, revive these dreadful
memories!”</p>

<p>However, Hamilton Gould broke in at this point, very
opportunely changing the conversation.</p>

<p>“Then,” he asked, “as you know us all, you were actually
on board the <cite lang="fr">Lorraine</cite>?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, sir,” replied Tom Bob. “Do you want
proofs? You occupied the state room No. 127, the Princess
Sonia Danidoff had a cabin port side; we enjoyed a first-rate
passage, though on the evening of the second day, a
bit of a gale blew up about six o’clock, and we feared
bad weather for next day. Is that correct?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely correct!” asseverated Mr. Van Buren.</p>

<p>After that the conversation turned on a more enticing
and more serious subject. Tom Bob had been announced
by the Parisian Press as the declared antagonist of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.
It was natural to question him as to the attitude
he proposed to adopt towards the notorious brigand. But
the American detective was not to be drawn, entrenching
himself behind what he called “professional secrecy.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bigelow gave a groan of terror.</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” she cried, “supposing <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> were
in this train and knew that you were here, too, Mr. Tom
Bob, and chose to blow us all up, it would be appalling!”</p>

<p>“It would be a very natural thing for <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> to do,
madam,” the detective replied, “but for certain reasons
<a id="png.095" href="#png.095"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>95<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I am well assured we have nothing to fear on that head.”</p>

<p>The young Frenchman, who some while before had accosted
Tom Bob, was just returning from the breakfast
car, a fat cigar in his mouth, eyes shining, and hat cocked
rakishly over one ear.</p>

<p>“First place,” he began in a quizzical voice, “Mister
detective, you have an easy job before you, for you must
know <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is in gaol.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, that’s true enough,” admitted Mr. Van Buren.</p>

<p>“Still, as Mr. Tom Bob is so clever, it’s to be hoped
he’ll meet him all the same and finish by arresting his
man.”</p>

<p><span class="ellips">...</span> “Egad! it’s deuced extraordinary,” suddenly exclaimed
Ascott, “here’s a go, I can’t find my pocketbook.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob gave a start.</p>

<p>“Look carefully, sir, look again; what you say is really
serious, you must make sure.”</p>

<p>With a pale face Ascott searched through all his pockets—everywhere.</p>

<p>“No, there’s no doubt whatever, my pocket-book has
disappeared; it’s not that I had a great deal of money in
it, but the thing is very unpleasant.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob lit a cigarette with a nonchalant air.</p>

<p>“Now that it’s known for sure your pocket-book has
disappeared, the only thing left to do is to get it back; that’s
not very difficult perhaps.”</p>

<p>All eyes turned in astonishment at Tom Bob, who
went on:</p>

<p>“A detective, and above all an American detective, owes
it to himself to discover in any assemblage of people, no
matter what, any pickpockets therein, and this at the first
glance.”</p>

<p>The young Frenchman started poking merciless fun at
the sententious and dogmatic language used by the American
detective:</p>

<p>“And pray, sir, by what do you know them?”</p>

<p>Tom Bob looked the youth up and down from head to
foot, and said nothing for a moment or two. Then he replied:
“By their boots.”</p>

<p>His audience held their sides. Decidedly Mr. Tom Bob
was an original and diverting travelling companion, and
everybody crowded to the far end of the corridor where he
<a id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>stood ensconced in a corner. The American detective
proceeded to harangue his listeners.</p>

<p>“The pickpockets on <i lang="fr">trains de luxe</i>,” he declared, “have
this much in common with the officers of the Criminal
Investigation Department, that they are usually ill-shod.
With one class as with the other, there is nothing, speaking
generally, to find fault with in the get-up. Hat from the
best maker, clothes of an irreproachable cut, tasteful necktie,
well-kept hands, everything proclaims the man of the
world; but there is a small detail, a grain of sand, the
proverbial grain of sand that throws the best adjusted
machine out of gear, and that grain of sand is nothing
more nor less than the <span class="prellips">footwear </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>Tom Bob broke off, and turning to the young Frenchman
who was listening with a highly quizzical smile:</p>

<p>“Sir,” he asked, “will you allow me to ask you a question—what
is your profession?”</p>

<p>At this direct and almost peremptory demand, the youth
blushed in some embarrassment. The answer came in a
dull, heavy voice:</p>

<p>“Why, sir, if I chose not to answer, I should be within
my rights and would tell you <span class="prellips">nothing </span><span class="ellips">...</span> But there, I
have nothing to hide—I am a student, a medical student,
sir.”</p>

<p>The young man was evidently annoyed and turning his
back on his questioner, he left the corridor.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a few moments after this, the train was
plunged into utter darkness. The track, after running for
some distance alongside the Seine near Bonnières, had
entered a tunnel. The Princess Danidoff’s anxious voice
was heard complaining: “Why isn’t the carriage lighted?
How very extraordinary!”</p>

<p>Tom Bob gave a sharp order:</p>

<p>“Have a care, ladies; look out, gentlemen; this darkness
is altogether abnormal; it is due to no negligence on
the part of the Company, but undoubtedly to the act of
some miscreant; guard your jewelry, watch your pockets.”</p>

<p>A few moments that seemed like hours, and then, issuing
suddenly from the bowels of the earth, the train regained
the light of day and sped on across the open country.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bigelow gave a cry; her reticule had vanished.
“My bag,” she groaned, “what has become of my little
<a id="png.097" href="#png.097"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>97<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bag? Why, it’s appalling, verily this land of France is
nothing but a den of thieves.”</p>

<p>Mr. Van Buren remarked: “I thought just now Mr. Bob was joking, but I am beginning to think he was
perfectly serious.”</p>

<p>“By Gad!” exclaimed Ascott, who could <em>not</em> believe
his pocket-book had really vanished and had just finished
turning his portmanteau upside down, “by Gad! I think
I ought to know something about it.”</p>

<p>The American detective was biting his lips with annoyance;
mechanically he lit a cigarette, then tossed it away,
only to light another.</p>

<p>A ticket collector passed along the train, shouting
“tickets! tickets, please!” But two passengers found themselves
unable to produce theirs—Ascott and Mrs. Bigelow.</p>

<p>The group in the corridor, already aware of the strange
disappearance of the Englishman’s pocket-book and the
American lady’s reticule, attacked the Company’s official,
complaining of the thefts, claiming the protection of French
law, threatening the most terrible reprisals. The unhappy
collector knew nothing about it and grasped only one fact,
to wit, that two passengers were travelling without tickets.
The discussion was growing acrimonious when Tom Bob
intervened.</p>

<p>“My good man,” he said, “will you be so good as not
to press this lady and gentleman for a few minutes; their
tickets are not lost, only mislaid—mislaid in somebody
else’s pocket; it will be all right, will it not, if the tickets
are handed to you before reaching Paris? I guarantee this
will be the case.” Bob’s specific undertaking reassured
the man. “Very good!” he said, “we’ll see about it at
<span lang="fr">Asnières</span>.”</p>

<p>Ascott was about to pester the detective with a string
of questions, but the latter stopped him with a shake of
the head.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” he said, “I think we’re slowing down.”</p>

<p>The train in fact was slackening speed, though no station
was in sight; on the contrary it had just run into the
Forest of <span lang="fr">Saint-Germain</span>; great trees bordered the line on
either side.</p>

<p>Tom Bob dashed hurriedly down the corridor, the train
going slower and slower all the time. Suddenly the
<a id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>detective sprang forward. The door opening from the corridor
on to the permanent way had been unfastened from the
inside by someone proposing to get out, presumably intending
to take advantage of the diminishing speed of the
train to jump down on to the ballast without fear of
accident.</p>

<p>Quick as this suspicious movement had been, Tom
Bob had forestalled it, seizing the individual by the collar.</p>

<p>“So ho! my young friend,” he cried, without relaxing
his hold, but on the contrary twisting his wrist hard, so as
to paralyse all resistance, “so you wanted to give your
friends the slip, did you? That’s not pretty behaviour,
upon my word!”</p>

<p>Pale as death, with a look of fear on his face, the other
growled in a savage voice:</p>

<p>“Let go, by God, let go, or I’ll kill you.”</p>

<p>But Tom Bob only smiled: “Kill me, eh?” he laughed,
“what with? with your revolver; just feel in your pocket
with your free hand, my fine little man, you’ll find your
gun’s not there any more.”</p>

<p>The startled thief gave a choking cry of terror; mechanically
he did as he was bid and searched his pocket. The
detective was right, his revolver had vanished.</p>

<p>“It was I confiscated it, my lad,” the detective informed
him, “you are too young to use such weapons handily;
a student, the deuce<span class="ellips">!...</span> a student like you can’t expect
to have the dexterity of a master like me; besides, we
have <em>this</em> little difference between us, I’m on the job for
honest reasons, while <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>The arrested fugitive threw himself on the ground,
hoping in this way to slip out of the detective’s grasp.
The latter went on calmly twisting the fellow’s arm, who
swore savagely, glaring like a trapped wild beast at his
captor.</p>

<p>Attracted by the noise of the struggle a number of
people had run to the spot; amongst the first to arrive
were Van Buren and Ascott. In a moment they had
realized what had occurred, and with a mighty cheer acknowledged
the wonderful perspicacity of their compatriot,
who had marked down among the throng of passengers the
individual who was undoubtedly the culprit and had arrested
him so cleverly. All recognized the man, it was the
<a id="png.099" href="#png.099"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>99<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>young Frenchman, the same who had given himself out as
a medical student.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bigelow had come to take a peep at Tom Bob’s
prisoner, and now rejoined Sonia Danidoff: “It is quite
true, my dear,” she confided to the princess, “Mr. Bob was
quite right, one must beware of people who are ill shod;
that man wore horrid bad boots.” The princess was very
pale and still quite unstrung: “It’s frightful, these things,
appalling; it has made me quite ill!”</p>

<p>Meantime the compartment into which, finding it by
chance unoccupied, the American detective had unceremoniously
pushed his prisoner, resounded with a chorus
of indignant outcries against the pseudo-student. As quick
as lightning the police-officer had secured the fellow’s wrists
with a miniature pair of handcuffs, so small as to be hardly
visible, but strong enough to bear any strain.</p>

<p>The Superintendent now appeared on the scene much
harassed by all these varied incidents, on which he would
have to make a circumstantial report, a task made the
more difficult by the fact that the worthy official, having
no actual knowledge of the details, was asking himself
which of the two parties was actually in the right and
which in the wrong, these foreign fashionables travelling
without tickets or the young Parisian whom an American
police-officer had taken upon himself to handcuff.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to hear a word,” declared the Superintendent,
“I’m not going to decide between you, you will
make your explanations to the Special Constabulary at
the terminus.”</p>

<p>“Nothing could be fairer,” Tom Bob agreed, adding
with characteristic phlegm: “At the same time, sir, if you
wish here and now to have the two missing tickets, all you
have to do is to search that young gentleman’s pockets, I
have no doubt they are in his possession.”</p>

<p>“I prefer to do nothing,” insisted the official, shaking
his head in a puzzled way, “I shall do nothing, you will
explain yourselves, as I said before, to the Constabulary
Office at <span lang="fr">Saint-Lazare</span>.”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">A quarter of an hour later, still in a state of breathless
excitement, the first class passengers of the Trans-Atlantic
express arrived at their journey’s end. Instead of leaving
<a id="png.100" href="#png.100"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the station, they all waited in silence on the platform where
the train had pulled up, formed up in two lines, between
which marched Tom Bob and his captive. They had
been the last to leave the train, but not unaccompanied;
four police-officers, to whom the Superintendent had beckoned
as the train ran in, escorted the pair, equally determined
that neither one nor the other, detective or culprit,
should escape.</p>

<p>Who was right and who was wrong? This was what
nobody knew. However, a few minutes later, before the
Special Commissary, light began to dawn. The individual
whom Tom Bob had accused of theft was searched. On
him was found Ascott’s pocket book, Mrs. Bigelow’s reticule—<em>and</em>
a leather purse, absolutely empty!</p>

<p>“Where have you put the money that was in this purse?”
asked the Commissary sternly.</p>

<p>But Tom Bob burst out laughing: “That purse was
empty to begin with, sir,” he declared, “I can assure you of
that much, for it is my own. It’s what I call my decoy-purse.
When I’m bent on looking after matters in a crowd,
I put it well in sight, hanging out of my vest pocket, and
wait events. The expected result never fails to arrive, the
pickpockets take me for a fool, make a dead set at me
and rob me with the more ease inasmuch as I help them
all I can. It doesn’t bring them in a lot, for I can’t afford
to be generous with them, but it has this great advantage,
it enables me to make the gentleman’s acquaintance. That,
Mr. Commissary, is how we do things in America, or at any
rate how Tom Bob, the American detective, does ’em!”</p>

<p>The Special Commissary looked at the American in
bewilderment, not unmixed with a touch of jealousy. It
could not be denied the man was very clever and he had
just done a pretty stroke of business, in which unfortunately
the French police could find little to boast about.
Still the Commissary thanked the detective, and added:</p>

<p>“We shall perhaps require you to give evidence, sir;
where shall I be able to find you?”</p>

<p>Tom Bob pencilled a few words on his card, saying at
the same time: “I have engaged rooms at the <span lang="fr">Hôtel
Terminus</span>; the police will always find me there at their
disposal.”</p>

<p>A minute or two more and Ascott recovered possession
<a id="png.101" href="#png.101"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of his pocket-book, and Mrs. Bigelow’s reticule returned to
its lawful owner. The Americans were one and all delighted,
and wished that very evening to celebrate their fellow-countryman’s
splendid triumph; Tom Bob, however, asked
modestly to be excused, declaring he was tired out, and
quickly disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<p>In the Commissary’s office, the requisite papers were in
preparation for the committal of the pickpocket when a
superior official entered.</p>

<p>“What is it, sir?” asked the Commissary.</p>

<p>“Why, this, sir; the individual in your charge is known
to the police.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about him?”</p>

<p>“That man is an old gaol-bird; we don’t know his proper
name, but among the crooks he goes by the nickname of
the ‘Beauty Boy’.”</p>

 ><small>MAD AS A HATTER</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">All</span> was bustle and movement in the great entrance-hall
of the <span lang="fr">Hôtel Terminus</span>, the imposing edifice that rears its
bulk immediately outside the <span lang="fr">Gare Saint-Lazare</span>; there
was a never ceasing coming and going of travellers, new
customers continually arriving from the trains reaching
Paris from all parts, others taking their departure for a
hundred different destinations in all quarters of the globe.
The throng was especially dense round a small office of
a severe and dignified aspect worthy of a public Ministry,
but more elegant in its furniture and appointments, where
three active young women were busy quickly and methodically
answering countless questions in a dozen different
languages, entering the names of the various newcomers
in a great ledger and indicating the rooms assigned them.</p>

<p>Amongst other applicants was the American Tom Bob,
cool and collected as always. In two minutes he had
completed the necessary formalities, and, under the guidance
of a servant of the hotel carrying his hand baggage, was
crossing the hall towards the lift. But turning suddenly
on the man, the traveller shook his head emphatically and
announced his intention of mounting by the stairs to the
suite he had previously engaged by wireless on the third
floor.</p>

<p>“I don’t like lifts,” he said peremptorily, and heedless
of the look of surprise on the servant’s face at so unusual
a preference, insisted on adopting the slower and more
fatiguing route.</p>

<p>Before reaching the foot of the grand staircase, however,
he was very unexpectedly—to the best of his belief the
American did not know a soul in all Paris—accosted by a
shabbily dressed young man, a total stranger to him, who
earnestly craved the favour of a few minutes’ conversation.</p>

<p>“I am a friend,” he urged eagerly and ingratiatingly, “of
<a id="png.103" href="#png.103"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>someone who knows you, who has often had occasion to
describe some of your exploits to me, and who, I have
no doubt whatever, would authorize me to use his name
to secure the interview I have the honour to beg of you, of
your kindness, to accord.”</p>

<p>Short and sharp, Tom Bob stopped him in mid career.</p>

<p>“I have not a friend in France,” he declared.</p>

<p>The young man smiled, not at all disconcerted, only
saying, in a very low whisper:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you have—one at any rate—<span lang="fr">Juve</span>!”</p>

<p>Not a muscle of Tom Bob’s face moved; nevertheless
the great American detective must have been well acquainted
with the name of the king of police-officers, nor
indeed could he well fail to know something of <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span>
famous doings, for he replied at once:</p>

<p>“Follow me, sir”—and putting an abrupt end to the
dialogue, he turned his back on the young man, and
marching on in front without a word of apology, started
to mount the stairs.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">“No. 142, here you are, sir! your luggage will be up in
ten minutes, sir.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob and the unknown stranger who followed him
had just been ushered into the room the detective had
engaged several days ago by wireless from mid-Atlantic.
Now, laying his hand on the waiter’s shoulder, he ordered
him:</p>

<p>“Have my luggage here in one hour from now, and not
before! I particularly wish not to be disturbed.”</p>

<p>The man looked at him in astonishment; this traveller
had tastes exactly the opposite of those of the ordinary
run of customers. However, the well-trained servant,
without a word indicating his surprise, went on:</p>

<p>“Here is the bell, sir—one ring for the waiter who
attends to your room, two for the chambermaid; this is
the cold water tap and there’s the hot; the electric switch
is by the head of the bed.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob was standing in the middle of the room and
gazing steadfastly at the ceiling while the man was speaking.
Then he put an odd question:</p>

<p>“How long ago was it the gentleman who has the bedroom
immediately over mine first came to the hotel?”</p>

<p><a id="png.104" href="#png.104"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>104<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The waiter stared, more surprised than ever. “I haven’t
an idea, sir,” he admitted; “but why?”</p>

<p>Tom Bob took the man by the shoulders and pushed
him gently out of the room:</p>

<p>“It interests me enormously. It is now twenty past
seven, you will find means to give me this information at
twenty past eight, in sixty minutes, when they bring up
my luggage. Now go!”</p>

<p>And now, when the servant was gone and the door shut
behind him, Tom Bob at last turned to the stranger,
who was, no less than the other, staring at him, bewildered
by his queer behaviour.</p>

<p>“You will excuse me, won’t you,” he asked, “but before I
give you my attention, I have a little piece of work to do.”</p>

<p>The other bowed, saying only by way of remonstrance:</p>

<p>“I must mention again, Mr. Bob, that what I have to
say is pretty <span class="prellips">urgent </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But the detective only smiled and cutting short his
protest: “There’s something else,” he declared, “that’s
very much more urgent, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Jérôme Fandor</span>.”</p>

<p>Then as the journalist gave a start of amazement at
hearing his name spoken—it was as a matter of fact <span lang="fr">Jérôme
Fandor</span> who had just now accosted the detective in the
entrance-hall and asked leave to speak with him—Tom
Bob, calm as ever, signified with an imperative gesture
that he was not to interrupt:</p>

<p>“Something very much more urgent, I repeat. Will
you be so kind as to help me in my little piece of work?”</p>

<p>More and more surprised, but confounded by his host’s
phlegm, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> nodded “yes,” without so much as opening
his lips.</p>

<p>“Then,” Tom Bob went on, “here’s how I start the job.
Look! I take off my <span class="prellips">hat </span><span class="ellips">...</span> so; then I plant my chair
against the <span class="prellips">wall </span><span class="ellips">...</span> so; I take my seat on the <span class="prellips">chair </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
Have you a pencil on you, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>?”</p>

<p>“I have, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very good! Will you be so very obliging as to take it
and draw a line on—on the door; see here, exactly on a
level with the top of my head.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> carried out the order, lost in astonishment.</p>

<p>“He’s mad,” he thought to himself; “the good man’s as
mad as a hatter! What does it all mean?”</p>

<p><a id="png.105" href="#png.105"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>His reflections were cut short by the detective, who
announced in his deliberate voice:</p>

<p>“The fact is, you see, I have a horror of high chairs.”
And as he uttered these extraordinary words, Tom Bob
got up and, kneeling down on the floor, turned the chair
he had been sitting on the minute before upside down, then
drew from his pocket a hunting-knife.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>, I’m not going to
open the blade; it is the saw I want to use.”</p>

<p>So saying, he extracted from the handle a little saw of
the kind often found in such knives.</p>

<p>“Go on, sir, go on!” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> protested. “Can I help
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, it’s done in a moment,” and as if he were
performing the most natural action in the world, Tom
Bob, still on his knees, began to saw off the legs of the
chair in front of him.</p>

<p>“I have a horror of high chairs,” he said for the second
time; “that’s why I saw off the legs, as you see, and convert
it into a low one; it’ll cost me a trifle to pay for the
damage, but what of that<span class="ellips">?...</span> Ah! that’s done!”</p>

<p>The detective had in fact abbreviated the chair legs by
eight or nine inches. He set the chair on its feet again,
and after making sure it stood firm, sat down; then springing
up again, still without uttering a word, he went over
to the bed standing on one side of the room, and picked
up a pillow and bolster, which he threw down near the wall.</p>

<p>“You are a young man, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>,” he remarked,
“you are not just come off a journey; you are not tired
like me; besides, I don’t want to demolish <em>all</em> the hotel
<span class="prellips">furniture </span><span class="ellips">...</span> in a word, will you be so kind as to seat
yourself on these improvised cushions<span class="ellips">?...</span> yes? cross-legged,
if you like.”<!-- TN: original has single quote --></p>

<p>This time <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> showed such a comic face of astonishment
that even the phlegmatic American could not help
smiling.</p>

<p>“I am not mad,” he observed simply by way of explanation,
“but I have a horror of seeing people sitting in high
chairs when I am myself seated in a low one—a whim,
<span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>, a monomania, if you like, of no importance<span class="ellips">....</span>
Now, what can I do for you?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> squatted on the ground in obedience to
<a id="png.106" href="#png.106"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the detective’s strange invitation, while the latter took <em>his</em>
place on the seat so oddly truncated.</p>

<p>“Sir,” declared the journalist, “the name I have mentioned,
the name of <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, must have informed you of the
object of my visit. You can <span class="prellips">guess </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But Tom Bob uttered a sharp protest: “No, I know
nothing, I cannot <em>guess</em>. Besides, I never guess; I infer,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless you guessed my name, Monsieur Tom
Bob?”</p>

<p>“Not at all! I only inferred you were <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> from the
fact that you invoked <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> name by way of introduction
to me and that, as I look at it, there can hardly be another
individual but you, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, to act so imprudently
as to name <span lang="fr">Juve</span> as guarantee, when <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is generally
taken to be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>On hearing the American’s words, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> sprang up
instinctively to grasp his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” he cried, “thank you for what you say, I
thank you from the bottom of my heart! At the first
word, I guessed you were to be an ally. <em>You</em> do not think,
do you, that <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?”</p>

<p>Tom Bob interrupted sharply again:</p>

<p>“I think I told you to sit on the floor! You get up
instead; you are in the wrong, you must do what I ask.
If you mean to jump up and down like this, I prefer to
put off the interview you desire till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But, <span class="prellips">sir </span><span class="ellips">...</span> but!” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> stammered, again bemused
with surprise, as he sat down again, while the other
insisted:</p>

<p>“There’s no ‘but’ about it; it is so! However, let’s
leave that. You did not come to see me, I presume, for
the mere pleasure of annoying me by standing? You came
to tell me something. What have you to tell me?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> called up all his coolness, shut his eyes a second,
pulled himself together, and now, in a calm voice, assented,
without troubling further about his interlocutor’s eccentricities:</p>

<p>“You are right, sir: I <em>have</em> come to tell you something,
to tell you this—I am indeed <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” broke in Tom Bob, “but how came you
to recognize me?”</p>

<p><a id="png.107" href="#png.107"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>107<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Gad! sir,” confessed <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, smiling innocently, “the
newspapers, announcing your sensational arrival the other
day, published your portrait, which no doubt they had among
their stock of blocks. I knew, moreover, that you would
land from the <cite lang="fr">Lorraine</cite>, saw the Trans-Atlantic special
come in, I followed you from the Commissary’s office which
you visited, I don’t know for what reason, to this hotel,
<span class="prellips">and </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>“Very good<span class="ellips">!...</span> Now, you came to tell me?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” replied <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, “you have challenged <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
to mortal combat; <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, as you know, has set himself
to terrorize Paris, to make war on France, on civilization
<span class="prellips">itself </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>Tom Bob interrupted again: “I have heard of <em>his</em>
challenge to the Chamber. Proceed!”</p>

<p>“Good!” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> agreed. “But <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> has committed
crimes you have not heard of. Yesterday a Minister
was <span class="prellips">killed </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“I know,” again affirmed the detective.</p>

<p>“Already?”</p>

<p>“Already<span class="ellips">?...</span> the papers I bought at <span lang="fr">Rouen</span>!”</p>

<p>“Then you also know that the day before yesterday,
Mr. Bob, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> murdered three police-officers, so arranging
it as to make it believed I was the criminal?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not know that.”</p>

<p>“In that case I will<!-- TN: original reads "well" --> tell you about it”—and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
proceeded to relate clearly and succinctly his extraordinary
adventure, concluding his narrative with the words:</p>

<p>“Which comes to this, Mr. Tom Bob, that at this
present moment not only does the fear of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
paralyse all Paris, but further, public opinion accuses
me of being <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> accomplice, or even <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
himself!”</p>

<p>All the time the young man was speaking, Tom Bob kept
nodding his approval at intervals. Now he broke in on
the other’s remarks.</p>

<p>“If you please,” he said, “better lie down, don’t you
think, on the floor instead of just crouching, as you are
now?” And as <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> gazed at him in a sort of panic, the
detective added in an explanatory tone:</p>

<p>“My monomania, you know! Don’t be <span class="prellips">alarmed </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
You were saying, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>, that people took you
<a id="png.108" href="#png.108"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>108<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>? But <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is in prison; he is generally
thought to be <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, I understand?”</p>

<p>“People don’t know what to think, sir. Certainly, two
weeks ago, everybody accepted this monstrous improbability;
now, in face of the new facts, they are doubtful. As
for me, as you may well suppose, I have never varied in
my belief. I know that <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is <span lang="fr">Juve</span>. You, sir, know it,
too.”</p>

<p>Again the detective nodded approval: “Certainly I do!
By reputation I know <span lang="fr">Juve</span> well; nay more, I have had
occasion to pursue certain inquiries in conjunction with
him. So I know he is not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. Besides which, like
public opinion, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>, I am for believing that
if <span lang="fr">Juve</span> <em>was</em> <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, the present crimes could not be
<span class="prellips">committed </span><span class="ellips">...</span> But, after all, in what you tell me, even
in your story of the strange attack of which you were the
victim, I see nothing particularly novel. What would you
propose to do?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> face paled: “It is something more than a
proposal, sir, that I am here to make you. When I read
the announcement of your arrival, and recalled all <span lang="fr">Juve</span>
had told me in praise of Tom Bob, I congratulated myself,
I say again, on the noble ally you would be for me, on
the fine opportunity I had of obtaining by you, and thanks
to you, <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> release from gaol—and that is the reason I
resolved to come to you and give you the means, at the
first moment after your arrival, to make a grand impression
on the French police.”</p>

<p>“I fail to understand you.”</p>

<p>“I will explain. Once succeed in effecting an arrest,
Monsieur Bob, a difficult arrest, within four and twenty
hours of your arrival in Paris, and you will instantly be
the hero of the day! They cannot any longer then affect
in high places the same indifference the French police will
certainly show towards you, chagrined as they are that
you should come to help them out of their difficulty. A
sensational arrest, loudly proclaimed and commended by
the Press, will give you prestige, add weight to your declaration,
when you come to declare, as I hope you will,
that <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.”</p>

<p>“And this arrest, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>?”</p>

<p>“This arrest, Monsieur Bob, I am going to tell you of.”</p>

<p><a id="png.109" href="#png.109"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>109<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Carried away by the importance of his statement, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
again rose to his feet. But barely a second did he retain
that attitude! Quick as thought, Tom Bob sprang from
his chair, fell on his knees, seized the journalist round the
waist and forced him back on the floor!</p>

<p>“Stay lying down, I tell you!” he ordered in a furious
voice; “have you no nose?”</p>

<p>“No nose?” stammered <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, really alarmed by the
detective’s conduct.</p>

<p>Already the latter had resumed his seat on his abbreviated
chair: “Forgive me,” he said with a smile—“my
monomania! only my monomania again<span class="ellips">!...</span> You were
saying?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> resolved to show no more surprise at anything,
and above all not to move again.</p>

<p>“This arrest,” he went on, “this sensational arrest that
is needed to give you prestige, I am going to supply you
with the means of carrying out. Some days ago an unfortunate
bank messenger was murdered in <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span>
house, the same house where, as I described just now, I
was myself the victim of mysterious violence. The police
at this present time have proved unable to discover either
the body of the victim or his murderer. His murderer,
I know, I denounce him here and now; it is, it must be,
it cannot but be <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>!”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”—and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> began a detailed account of how
he had come to know that dubious man of business. He
said how he associated with notorious apaches, how he
was habitually engaged in shady transactions with those
gentry, that in particular he was the intimate and friend
of a bully, one <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>. He concluded: “There is besides
a damning piece of evidence against him. While I was
in the Chinese lantern, where <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had imprisoned
me, I saw the officers find in the garret a button from the
uniform of the bank collector who has disappeared. This
garret belongs to <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, it was in this garret the crime
was committed. <span lang="fr">Moche</span> must be the criminal. You will
understand, Mr. Bob, that after I had crept away along
the house-roofs after my extraordinary adventure, I could
not, under pain of being immediately arrested, return to
make investigations at <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span>. Nor have the police,
<a id="png.110" href="#png.110"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>on their side, being convinced that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is responsible
for the murder of the collector and that I am <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
troubled <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>. <em>You</em> are free to act: I beseech <em>you</em> to
move heaven and earth to clear up with all speed the
mystery of the bank <span lang="fr">employé’s</span> death.”</p>

<p>The detective nodded his comprehension.</p>

<p>“What you tell me is interesting, very <span class="prellips"><span class="xellips">inter</span></span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But, cutting him off short, with a dull roar that was
unmistakable, an explosion shook the room. It came from
above the two men’s heads, like a hurricane sweeping by.
Facing them, fragments of plaster, bits of the woodwork,
broke away, and the wall was pitted with little holes. A
thick, acrid smoke, smelling like gunpowder, rolled through
the room in heavy blue-grey wreaths.</p>

<p>Tom Bob did not so much as start; <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> stammered
a terrific oath. Then after a moment’s silence, the detective
in the calmest way completed his interrupted sentence:
“<span class="ellips">...</span> Very interesting what you are telling me<span class="ellips">;...</span> but
what has just happened is interesting, too. And now,
<span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>, you can stand up.”</p>

<p>But a loud knocking was heard at the door. A waiter
was asking:</p>

<p>“What is the matter—an accident?”</p>

<p>“No,” Tom Bob assured him, without opening, “an incident.
I was shaving and my water-heater burst <span class="ellips">...</span> only
tell them to bring up my luggage in an hour and a half’s
time, not before.”</p>

<p>The detective’s voice was so calm the man seemed satisfied,
while amid the never ending turmoil of the great hotel
the violent explosion in the room had apparently passed
almost unnoticed.</p>

<p>When the waiter was gone, Tom Bob got up from his
chair, remarking:</p>

<p>“So now, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>, you understand why I made
such a point of our both being seated as close to the ground
as possible.”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> shook his head. “I don’t understand anything
at all,” he protested.</p>

<p>“Well, go and look at the pencil line you drew just
now, on a level with my head.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> ran to the wall and could not restrain an exclamation:</p>

<p><a id="png.111" href="#png.111"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>111<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“By the Lord! the line is exactly in the zone riddled by
the explosion of the bomb!”</p>

<p>“It was not a bomb.”</p>

<p>“Not a bomb? What was it then?”</p>

<p>“A shot fired by <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.”</p>

<p>“By <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?”</p>

<p>“Precisely, by <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.”</p>

<p>The other’s calm was so wonderful, his imperturbability
so complete, that <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> felt almost ashamed of himself
to be so profoundly agitated. Once again he called upon
his strength of will power and mastered his feelings. In
a quiet voice he asked:</p>

<p>“Well then, sir, what <em>has</em> happened? Why did you ask
me to mark just that height on the wall? You
guessed<span class="ellips">?...</span>”</p>

<p>Tom Bob, hands in pockets, was looking up at the top
of a tall wardrobe.</p>

<p>“I did not guess anything,” he said. “I never guess, I
infer.”</p>

<p>“But what have you inferred then?”</p>

<p>“Why, I <span class="prellips">observe </span><span class="ellips">...</span>”</p>

<p>“But, good Lord, what do you observe?”</p>

<p>“What occurs, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>! Now look here, is it,
yes or no, a logical conclusion that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> was put out
by my arrival? Was it, yes or no, logical to conclude that
knowing, as everybody knows, thanks to my wireless messages,
that I am setting to work to arrest him, while <em>he</em>
proposes to terrify Paris and force the Chambers to satisfy
his demands, was it, I ask again, logical to suppose
that he was going to try to murder me?”</p>

<p>“Logical, why yes; but how did you guess?”</p>

<p>“I argued, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>; I argued that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
wishing to murder me, would do it as swiftly as possible;
consequently, if I wished to escape his criminal manœuvres,
it was advisable to lay a trap for him. The trap consisted
in engaging a room here. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> knew of this. How,
I cannot say, but <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> knows everything. For my
part, <em>I</em> knew—knowledge is power—I knew that, on my
coming to the Terminus, an attempt was going to be made
on my life. What sort of an attempt? I felt uncertain.
I suspected the lift—that risk avoided, in revenge I was
pretty well convinced, when I entered this room, the room
<a id="png.112" href="#png.112"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>112<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I had engaged in advance, that something was going to
happen here. But what? I thought of a poisonous gas
infiltrated during the night, and that is why I questioned
the waiter about the occupant of the room above. <span lang="fr">Monsieur
Fandor</span>, I told you you had no nose, did I not?
The fact is I am astonished that you didn’t, like me, detect
in the room a faint smell of burning, of burning tinder.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, lost in admiration at the precision of the American
detective’s discoveries, the nature of which he was
beginning to fathom, declared: “I noticed the smell of
burning perfectly well, <span class="prellips">but </span><span class="ellips">...</span>”</p>

<p>“But you drew no inference from it. <em>I</em> inferred that
a slow-match was burning—but where? To search for it
was running a risk, an incautious movement might precipitate
the crisis. Instead, I said to myself, <span lang="fr">Monsieur
Fandor</span>—the natural thing for a traveller to do when he
enters a bedroom is to sit down. Therefore it is more
than probable, if a shot is to be fired, from a revolver say,
or from a gun, that the weapon will be levelled at the height
of a person’s head seated on a chair. I cut down my chair
so as to be below the line of fire! I made you sit on the
floor to save you from being hit!”</p>

<p>One thing, and one thing only, could <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> find to say
to express his admiration adequately: “<span lang="fr">Juve</span> could not
have done better!”</p>

<p>“Truly, it was not so bad. Now, if you would like to
get to the bottom of things, we will take a look on top
of that <span class="prellips">wardrobe </span><span class="ellips">...</span> There, what did I say?”</p>

<p>From the top of the wardrobe Tom Bob, mounted on a
chair, proceeded to unship a sort of gatling-gun, consisting
of six barrels fixed side by side, the muzzles of which,
arranged fan-wise, commanded the whole room.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see,” the detective concluded, “it’s all as
plain as daylight. Here’s how <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> set to work. He
hired this room, up to seven or eight o’clock this morning,
I imagine. Seeing it was taken for to-night by me, it
was evident no one would occupy it between us two. On
top of the wardrobe he lashed an extraordinary contrivance
loaded up with grape-shot, which swept the whole place
with a hurricane of lead; to touch off the charge, he laid
down a slow-match of tinder.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> shook his head: “No,” he objected, so enthralled
<a id="png.113" href="#png.113"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>113<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in spite of himself by the interest of the investigation as
to have completely recovered his clearness of mind; “you
seem to forget one detail; if he lit the slow-match before
leaving, it’s ten to one the smoke would have been noticed
by the hotel waiter. Then besides, it would have needed a
great length of slow-match, and that meant risking a <span class="prellips">conflagration </span><span class="ellips">...</span>”</p>

<p>But Tom Bob indulged in another meaning smile, as he
said:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> left, I suppose, about eight in the morning,
quite early anyway; but his match was not lit till two or
three o’clock in the afternoon. You needn’t be surprised,
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, the trick is quite elementary! Look there, on the
carpet, near the wardrobe; you see those little shards
of glass? the fragments of a burning-glass! The tinder was
set alight by means of that lens, scientifically adjusted for
the precise moment when the sun had reached the altitude
chosen by <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. It’s really very ingenious, after all!”</p>

<p>And as <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> remained silent, struck dumb with admiration
for the coolness displayed by the American, who
had thus escaped by a hair’s breadth the terrible machinations
of a murderer, and at the same time saved his companion
from a hideous death, Tom Bob resumed:</p>

<p>“The present business being now cleared up, and <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
responsible for yet another attempted murder, let
us pass on to serious matters. <em>This</em> is not really important,
as it only concerns two of his individual enemies, you and
<span class="prellips">me </span><span class="ellips">...</span> You were telling me just now, that <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> was
guilty of the bank messenger’s murder<span class="ellips">?...</span> h’m, that’s
not so sure. Come, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>, just give me a little
information about the man’s associates.”</p>

<p>At the detective’s invitation <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had at last installed
himself comfortably in a big armchair.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Moche’s</span> associates,” he said, “are a deplorably bad lot;
to begin with, amongst other notorious ruffians, I can give
you the names, or rather the nicknames, of several,
‘Beardy,’ ‘the Beadle,’ ‘the Cellarman,’—women too,
‘Big Ernestine,’ little <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, who, I told you before, has for
her fancy man, the bully <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>—calls himself a stone-mason,
even works at his trade in his spare moments, for I
know <span lang="fr">Moche</span> has lately given him several jobs to do; then
there is ‘Beauty Boy,’ another choice blackguard, <span class="prellips">and </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”<!-- TN: in this paragraph the original used double quotes for the nicknames --></p>

<p><a id="png.114" href="#png.114"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>114<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>But Tom Bob suddenly interrupted his informant.</p>

<p>“I am dog tired,” he declared, “and half dropping asleep.
Listen here, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fandor</span>, my own opinion is, an
investigation is advisable before deciding on anything. I
give you my word I will <span class="prellips">investigate </span><span class="ellips">...</span>”</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XII<br
 ><small>A STROKE OF GENIUS</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">The</span> American detective Tom Bob was no ordinary man.
The very first day after his arrival he had signalized his
presence and drawn public attention to himself in a manner
at once original and redounding greatly to his credit.
Within a few hours of landing on French soil he had shown
his mettle by the arrest of a dangerous malefactor, a professional
criminal, “Beauty Boy,” the apache. The same
day he had adroitly escaped an abominable attempt on his
life, and, to crown all, in the course of a series of interviews
accorded to the reporters of the different newspapers, he
had, in direct contradiction to the generally received opinion,
stoutly maintained that the ex-journalist <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, the bosom
friend of the man <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, now incarcerated in the prison of
<cite lang="fr">La Santé</cite>, was a very honest man, the last person to have
committed the crimes imputed to him.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">For several days, in fact up to the time Tom Bob had
come to divert the public curiosity, the Inspectors of the
Criminal Investigation Bureau had carried out the most
minute investigations at the house where the bank messenger’s
murder was supposed, if not to have been committed,
at any rate to have been planned and prepared.
For whole days together police-officers in plain clothes
pursued careful inquiries, questioning the inmates, even
going so far as to collect evidence as to the past life and
antecedents of each of the tenants.</p>

<p>True, no actual trace had been found of the unfortunate
<span lang="fr">employé</span> of the <span lang="fr">Comptoir National</span>, but the uniform button
discovered in the garret where <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> had with such
misplaced generosity, as he said himself, given a charitable
asylum to <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> made it reasonable to conclude, without
any undue pressing of the evidence, that the collector had
disappeared not of his own free will and initiative, but
<a id="png.116" href="#png.116"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>116<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>simply because he had been first robbed and then murdered.
Was the same assassin also responsible for the
death of the police-officers? Was <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> the author of
both crimes? Many members of the Department were
inclined to think he was, though others hesitated to commit
themselves to any definite opinion.</p>

<p>At any rate, there was one certainty, one sure fact, that
delighted the inmates of No. 125 <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>, to
wit, that the police, diverted from the old line of scent
and henceforth mainly preoccupied to discover the assassin
of <span lang="fr">Désiré Ferrand</span>, were more or less relaxing in their
embarrassing attentions, and no longer exercised the same
constant and careful surveillance over the scene of the first
tragedy.</p>

<p>At an early hour one morning, three or four days after
Tom Bob’s arrival in Paris, old <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, looking just as
dubious and dirty as usual, reached his office in the <span lang="fr">Rue
Saint-Fargeau</span>, where he had not been for several days—not
that this was a matter to cause the concierge any
surprise, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> being habitually a decidedly intermittent
occupier of his rooms. The old man seemed in
jovial spirits. With little, quick steps he mounted the
stairs, whistling a tune; then inserting a key in the lock,
he entered his flat. But the old brigand, a cautious man
ever since his adventure with <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> and <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, took good
care to double lock the door again behind him. Changing
his long frock-coat for a short jacket, and planting on top
of the wig that covered his bald pate a velvet skull-cap in
place of his silk-hat, the old fellow set to work to sort out
the numerous letters that had arrived by post. To tell
the truth, he did not take the trouble to open them, for
he knew by merely glancing at the address what each contained,
to wit, nothing whatever—a sheet of blank paper
or a cutting from an old newspaper. The fact is, <span lang="fr">Moche</span>
was in a better position than anyone to know beforehand
the contents of each of his letters, inasmuch as, being
desirous of putting the concierge off the scent and impressing
him by the voluminous correspondence intended
for him, the old man had the habit of every day addressing
a dozen letters and prospectuses to himself! It
was a dodge to make people believe he really followed the
profession of a business agent and could boast a numerous
<i lang="fr">clientèle</i>.</p>

<p><a id="png.117" href="#png.117"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>117<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>This time, however, in sorting his letters, <span lang="fr">Moche</span> put
one aside; this particular one he did <em>not</em> recognize, and
discontinuing his scrutiny, he tore open the envelope in
feverish haste. It was written on good paper—evidently
from a correspondent of importance. <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> read:</p>

<p>“<i>Sir—I have to inform you that I have just arrived in
Paris and propose to call on Wednesday morning at your
office. You obliged me some time ago by a loan of money;
I now intend to discharge the debt. I am therefore coming
to repay <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span></i>”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, “a pleasant surprise to
come! for once a debtor writes to say he is going to pay
up without any need to twist his tail. Well, the exception
proves the rule; all the same I rather doubt what it all
means.”</p>

<p>Then he jumped to the fourth page and examined the
signature.</p>

<p>“By the Lord,” he exclaimed, “it’s my young friend
<span class="prellips">Ascott </span><span class="ellips">...</span> Ascott, that feeble-minded Englishman I have
heard nothing of for a very long time—though I never felt
any anxiety about the man. Egad! I knew very well
he’d been in Paris the last eight and forty hours! is there
anything that happens <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> <em>doesn’t</em> know? Let’s
see what else the young gentleman has to say<span class="ellips">?...</span> He
wants to settle up with me, a very laudable intention, coming
from a very honest man. Now how much does the
chap owe me?”</p>

<p>Leaving the letter on his desk, the old man trotted over
to his safe, opened it, and hauling out a ledger began
turning over the leaves eagerly.</p>

<p>“<em>Ascott</em>, here we are! yes, eighteen months ago I lent
him 15,000 francs; unless my calculations are all wrong,
at the rate of interest agreed upon, he ought to pay me
back to-day 22,000. Ah ha! not a bad bit of business! If
only a man could have windfalls like that every day, he
would be a millionaire in double quick time!”</p>

<p>So saying, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> locked up the book again in the
strong-box, and came back to his desk, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>“I’ve only read the first few lines of his letter,” he said
to himself, “and there’s four pages of the stuff. Can it by
any chance be that Ascott at the end of his epistle has
modified the good intentions expressed at the beginning?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> took up the letter again and skimmed through
<a id="png.118" href="#png.118"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>118<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it eagerly. “No,” he said, his face brightening, “no, he
really means to pay me back.”</p>

<p>But a look of chagrin suddenly darkened his ugly face.</p>

<p>“Why, this is vexing,” he muttered; “now he doesn’t need
me any more, he scorns me, he wishes us to break off all
relations, he intends never to see me again. Oh, ho!
none of that, my fine fellow! Just when the goose is fatted,
I’m to part with it, eh? No fear, I’m not such a fool!
It’s up to you, my good <span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>, to arrange things
so as to creep up Mister Ascott’s sleeve from now on—and
now more than ever.”</p>

<p>The old advocate was at this point in his lucubrations,
more and more convinced that at all hazards he must
remain the rich young Englishman’s friend, when he was
startled by a loud knock at the door.</p>

<p>“That’s Ascott,” thought <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, “let’s be quick and
let him in.” The old fellow darted to the entrance of his
modest dwelling; rapidly turned the key in the lock and
threw the door wide open.</p>

<p>To his profound surprise he found the newcomer was
not the elegantly dressed gentleman he expected to see,
but a little woman in a flowered <i lang="fr">peignoir</i>, her hair down
her back and her feet crammed into an old pair of sandals.
It was <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, who had come down from the floor
above to pay a neighbourly visit to <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>.</p>

<p>“Halloa!” cried the child, who, without waiting for an
invitation, had slipped into <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> office behind the
barred partition, “why, you’re a regular bird of passage!
never at home, always out! Every time I pass your door,
I knock, I ring a peal, I stand there waiting—nothing!
nobody! the bird’s flown, the old fox is not in his earth.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Nini</span> was both angry and excited, as she stood before
the old man, passing a feverish hand over her pale brow
and ruffling her black locks, while the other looked at her
without moving a muscle or saying a word.</p>

<p>“I’m in a hole,” went on the young baggage, “and I’ve
got to get out of it, <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>; I’m fed up with the
whole business, I am! Anyway, here’s straight talking—if
you don’t go the way I want, I’ll just be off and blow
the gaff to the police mugs.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never do that, <span lang="fr">Nini</span>,” the old man expostulated
in cajoling tones, “you’re much too nice a girl.”</p>

<p><a id="png.119" href="#png.119"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>119<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>But <span lang="fr">Nini</span> declined to be softened by compliments: “I
shall do what I say,” she asseverated.</p>

<p>“But come, out with it! what’s it all about?” <span lang="fr">Moche</span>
demanded.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about, eh?” returned the girl, “why, it’s
as clear as mud. I’m in a tight place, and other folks
are going to be there too if things go on as they are. To
begin with, I’ve had enough of living with <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>; he
frightens me, the man frightens me! Ever since I saw him
do in the bank chap, I’m terrified all the time he’ll do
my business for me, too. He’s no spunk at all; it’s not
blood he has in his veins, it’s water; I sleep with him and
I know what I’m talking about; every night he lies and
sweats; it’s fear, that’s what it is! He dreams of the police,
he dreams about the dead man, he yells out in his sleep.
The man’s all broke to pieces, he’ll come to a bad end;
if ever the ’tecs come questioning him a bit close, he’ll never
have gumption enough to put ’em off with blarney, and
then, by God! we’ll all be in the soup!”</p>

<p>“Alas! my dear child,” murmured the old fellow hypocritically,
“what do you want me to do; all that business
has nothing to do with me. You have killed a man, the
stolen money has disappeared, you understand, disappeared,
nobody can say where it is. Now suppose they accused
me, the thing wouldn’t hold water for a moment; for why?
because I’m well known as an honest, respectable business
man. So get out of your own difficulties!”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact <span lang="fr">Nini</span> had from the first understood
perfectly well what attitude old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> would adopt under
the circumstances. Not a doubt of it, if things turned out
badly, the old business agent was clever enough to pull his
iron safely out of the fire, and certainly cynical enough
to leave his confederates in the lurch. But <span lang="fr">Nini</span> had no notion
of things going like that; she strode up to <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>,
and shaking her little fist in the old man’s wrinkled face:</p>

<p>“As sure as my name’s <span lang="fr">Nini</span>,” she swore, “if ever we
get run in for this job, I give you my oath, <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>,
you’ll leave every feather of your dirty plumage behind;
but if we come to an <span class="prellips">agreement </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“If we come to an <span class="prellips">agreement </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>” the advocate repeated
the phrase with newly-aroused interest.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” <span lang="fr">Nini</span> went on, assuming the soft, coaxing,
<a id="png.120" href="#png.120"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wheedling voice every woman can use on occasion, “if we
come to some agreement in case of trouble arising, we shall
be two, you and I, to say we have nothing whatever to do
with the affair of the bank messenger, and that it was
<span lang="fr">Paulet</span> who did the trick all by himself, and got all there
was to be got out of <span class="prellips">it </span><span class="ellips">...</span> There!”</p>

<p>The offer of partnership thus formulated by the young
slut was just the sort of thing to appeal to the old usurer.
Nodding his head approvingly:</p>

<p>“Your notion’s really not such a bad one, my little girl,”
he said; “only, what’s to become of you?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Nini</span>, encouraged by the way the interview was shaping,
had dropped nonchalantly into the one and only armchair<!-- TN: hyphen removed for consistency -->
the room contained. Now, with eyes fixed on the ceiling,
the girl sat in a day-dream, a prophetic dream.</p>

<p>“I have a sort of a notion,” she murmured, “that with all
these new complications, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> is going to get cotched.
First, there’s that journalist <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> drawing attention to
the house; then they find the button off the poor devil’s
uniform in your garret; <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> disappears; on the other
hand Tom Bob arrives. What does the fellow count for?
I don’t know, but I have my doubts; he must be pretty
smart, he nabbed ‘Beauty Boy’ in less time than it takes
to tell the story! So then, it all comes to this—little <span lang="fr">Nini’s</span>
had enough, thank you, she’s got to bolt, and that at sixty
miles an hour, and Papa <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, who’s no fool neither, has
got to find her a place, for choice with the nobs, to save
her from any future worries. Does that suit your book,
<span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>? Is that settled, eh<span class="ellips">?...</span> You’ll clearly understand
this, I didn’t leave the bosom of my family to go
and rot on Devil’s Island or be eaten up by the mosquitoes
at New Caledonia.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> was prodigiously diverted by this announcement
of her principles of action on the part of <span lang="fr">Paulet’s</span>
girl mistress. Undoubtedly there was something to be made
of this little minx with the wide-awake look and bright
eyes, so vicious and so astute. He was about to reply,
when suddenly a peal on the door bell was heard.</p>

<p>“Who’s that coming?” <span lang="fr">Nini</span> asked anxiously, as she
instinctively laid a hand on her bosom to restrain the
excited beating of her heart.</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> reassured her: “It’s nine o’clock,” he said.
<a id="png.121" href="#png.121"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“No doubt it’s a client who has an appointment. Hide
yourself; I’m going to take him into the salon; then you’ll
cut your stick while I’m receiving him.” <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was
right; on opening the door he found himself face to face
with the young Englishman, Mr. Ascott, whose abusive
letter he had been reading half an hour before. <span lang="fr">Moche</span>
with the supple servility that belonged to his mean, cautious
nature, was lavish in bowings and scrapings, bending to
the ground before the wealthy foreigner, while the latter,
with an icy dignity, barely acknowledged his creditor’s
courtesies with a curt nod:</p>

<p>“If milord will condescend to step into my reception
room<span class="ellipsp">?...</span>” suggested <span class="prellips" lang="fr">M. Moche </span><span class="ellips">...</span></p>

<p>Ascott obeyed mechanically, but disclaimed the rank
his host had given him.</p>

<p>“I am not Lord Ascott, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>; I am plain
Mr. Ascott; the title of lord belongs to my honoured father.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” suggested the old man with a tactless grin,
“a father—a father may die one fine day, and if I’m not
mistaken, the sons inherit both the money and all the
privileges and prerogatives.”</p>

<p>The young man shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>“I forbid you to speak of my honoured father, sir; and
besides that, you must know that in no case shall I bear
the title; I am a younger son of the family, my older
brother will be My Lord.”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was incorrigible and went on to insinuate:</p>

<p>“The elder brother no <span class="prellips">doubt </span><span class="ellips">...</span> but suppose he should
happen to die, too.”</p>

<p>Ascott stamped his foot angrily and cast a furious look
at the old money-lender.</p>

<p>“That is enough, sir,” he declared in an indignant voice
quivering with restrained anger, “that is enough! let us
settle up our accounts; that done, we will break off all
relations.”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was for slipping away: “Forgive me, dear
sir, noble gentleman, honourable signor, if I trouble you
to wait a few moments, but there is a lady in my office,
a very important client; I must conclude my business with
her. By your <span class="prellips">leave </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>” <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, with another low bow,
awaited the reply. “Get done, and be quick about it!”
was the rough answer.</p>

<p><a id="png.122" href="#png.122"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>122<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The old brigand went back immediately to the office,
where <span lang="fr">Nini</span> was still waiting; she had never budged.
<span lang="fr">Moche</span> approached her with an air of triumph, calling
softly:</p>

<p>“Come here, little girl!” and on her obeying, drew her
to the window, setting her with her face to the full light.
With his coarse, hairy hands the old usurer lifted the child’s
touzled locks, parted them on her forehead and imprisoned
the tangled curls in his palm. <span lang="fr">Nini</span> let him do as he liked,
puzzled and uncomprehending.</p>

<p>“D’you know,” declared the old man, “d’you know, with
your hair down like a little girlie, you look ever so young.”</p>

<p>“But,” protested <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, “I’m not old; I’m barely sixteen
and a half.”</p>

<p>“I daresay,” resumed the other, “and when you don’t
put on your naughty look and haven’t been drinking, you
might verily be taken for a little saint. Now let’s see your
hands.”</p>

<p>Again <span lang="fr">Nini</span> did as she was bid, and <span lang="fr">Moche</span> spreading out
the fingers on his fore-arm, examined the nails. “Quite
good, again,” he announced, “carefully enough kept for a
poor man’s child, and not too well kept neither, to make
them think it’s a ‘gay woman’s’ hand.”</p>

<p>Next moment, taking the girl by the shoulders, he gazed
fixedly into her face with the air of one inspired.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Nini</span>,” he cried, “I have a brilliant idea, and if only
you’re not too clumsy, we’re going, you and I, to do something
mighty smart. <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, next door there I’ve got a ripe
pear, it’s up to you to pluck it; only, listen to me, I give
you ten minutes to rig yourself out—not, mind you, like a
street wench, but like an innocent little maid; leave your
hair down, don’t wear a hat, put on your plainest frock,
drop your eyes, look sweet and modest, and think of what
you were a year ago, a good little virtuous girl, living with
her mother and just done learning up her catechism. Presently,
that is to say directly you’re ready, come and pay
me a visit<span class="ellips">....</span> I’m good for the rest!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Nini</span> did not need telling twice: “I’m fly,” she declared,
slapping the old fellow shrewdly on the back. Then, lightly
and airily, she darted off.</p>

<p>“She’s a jewel!” thought <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, as he noted the
tricksy grace of the young harlot, “with a bit of training,
<a id="png.123" href="#png.123"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>123<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and if she’ll but listen to me, I’ll make something of the
girl!”</p>

<p>But this was no time for day-dreams.</p>

<p>Reassuming an air of gravity and importance, <span lang="fr">Moche</span>
went in search of his client, whom he invited to return
with him to the office.</p>

<p>Such was the geniality displayed by the old usurer that
the phlegmatic Englishman, who had come to see him
with the clear and definite intention of exchanging simply
and solely the words absolutely necessary to effect the
repayment he wished to make, allowed himself little by little
to be drawn into conversation.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Moche</span>,” declared Ascott, “here are your twenty-five
notes of a thousand francs; you will give me a receipt.”</p>

<p>“Why certainly, most noble sir, with the greatest pleasure.”</p>

<p>But the old scamp feigned forgetfulness: “You owed me
twenty-five thousand francs you say; <em>was</em> that the sum?”
he asked innocently.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five thousand, yes,” Ascott repeated.</p>

<p>In reality it was three thousand less, but the old thief
took good care not to recall the fact! Wishing to complete
the formalities with a certain solemnity, he went over to
his strong-box—there was actually next to nothing in it—and
drew out the one and only article it contained, the big
ledger to wit. After turning over a number of blank
leaves, he opened at the page showing Ascott’s name. For
a long time the business man hung over the columns of
figures as if making a series of complicated calculations.
At last he looked up:</p>

<p>“My excellent client,” he said gravely, “you will excuse
my contradicting you, but it is not twenty-five thousand
francs you owe me, it is merely twenty-four thousand, five
hundred; I am nothing if not honest; I wouldn’t wrong
you by one single centime.”</p>

<p>The effect of this declaration was to make the young
Englishman laugh: “Egad! <span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>,” he declared,
“they’ve changed you surely, the thing’s impossible!”</p>

<p>But the usurer put on his grandest air: “My dear sir,
strict probity in business is my maxim! I assure you it
pays, the future is to the men of honour, and it’s just
because I am conscientious that I benefit by the fidelity
<a id="png.124" href="#png.124"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>124<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of my clients. You yourself, <span lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Ascott, will certainly
require my services again some day, and you may
rely on always finding me devoted to your interests.”</p>

<p>“That,” Ascott broke in drily, “I cannot promise; I
don’t care, I tell you frankly, to have relations with men
of your stamp. In the last eighteen months I’ve been
travelling up and down the world, I have changed very
much, I have money now; I am going to make a home in
Paris, where I propose to live as a good citizen, spending
no more than my income.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been told,” <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> interrupted, “that you
have just bought a delightful little house in the <span lang="fr">Rue
Fortuny</span>.”</p>

<p>“How came you to know that?” demanded Ascott, not
denying the fact.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, “in the great world of business
and finance to which I belong, we know pretty well everything
that happens.”</p>

<p>“Really?” said Ascott incredulously, amazed to think that
so insignificant a person as <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, a moneylender of a
low type, could be in any way connected with the big
and highly respected bankers of the <span lang="fr">Place de Paris</span> through
whom he had negotiated the purchase of the house in the
<span lang="fr">Rue Fortuny</span>. But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was well posted without a
doubt. By a fresh question he more than ever surprised
the rich Englishman; he now suggested, speaking out
without any reticence or beating about the bush:</p>

<p>“Doubtless it’s to build a pretty nest for a grand mistress
you’ve bought that exquisite house; I <em>have</em> heard
say that a certain <span lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Ascott, here present, is head
over ears in love with a certain Russian princess named
Sonia Danidoff, with whom he crossed the Atlantic on
board the <cite lang="fr">Lorraine</cite>.”</p>

<p>Ascott sprang up in extreme agitation.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Moche</span>,” he cried, “you think you are a wonderful
man who knows everything, but you are behind the fair,
my friend, this time; yes, I admit, I <em>was</em> deeply in love
with the Princess Danidoff, and I confess I was in hopes
that in France, after the persevering court I paid her, she
would at last consent to grant me her favours—but events
have decided otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Poor <span lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Ascott!” murmured <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>. Then
<a id="png.125" href="#png.125"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he added, casting a side glance at his companion to judge
of the effect of his words:</p>

<p>“To think that fool princess prefers a common detective
to you!”</p>

<p>Ascott literally flew at the old villain’s throat, and
shaking him by the shoulder,</p>

<p>“So then,” he vociferated, “so then, you know everything?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> smiled quietly:</p>

<p>“No, not everything,” he protested, “but some little
matters<span class="ellips">!...</span> I take it the Princess Danidoff has no
more brains than a sparrow, she must be out of her wits
to like this low-class police spy better than <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> suddenly stopped dead: “I beg your pardon,
but there’s someone knocking,” he exclaimed, and went
to open the door, pretending to be greatly surprised.</p>

<p>Throwing out his arms and speaking loud enough for
Ascott to hear him, he greeted the visitor warmly:</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! little <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, it’s you, is it? what a stroke of
luck! How is my dear sister, your good mother? d’you
bring me good news?”</p>

<p>Like a finished actress, <span lang="fr">Nini</span> stood up on tiptoe, threw
her arms round the old scamp’s neck and kissed him on
the brow tenderly, but respectfully. <span lang="fr">Paulet’s</span> mistress had
perfectly well understood <span lang="fr">Père Moche’s</span> instructions. With
her modest, decent get-up, she had all the appearance, all
the charm of youth, freshness and purity, of an honest
little Paris workgirl, one of those pretty flowers that
bloom in many a happy home of good, respectable, industrious
working people. The girl was entirely charming
with her virginal air of innocence and chastity.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> was all smiles as he looked at her; such was
the old scamp’s artfulness in disguising his true feelings
that as he stood beside the young girl he offered the very
picture of a kind, good uncle, proud and happy in the
beauty of his little niece! The man seemed to forget his
sordid trade amid these tokens of family affection. Like
a father proud of his child, he turned to Ascott, who had
been the interested witness of this intimate and touching
little scene.</p>

<p>“Allow me, my dear sir,” he said, “to introduce my
young niece <span lang="fr">Eugénie Guinon</span>, a good little workgirl, who
<a id="png.126" href="#png.126"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>126<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>makes at this present time her three francs a day. She’s
barely sixteen, but a tall girl, don’t you think for her age?”</p>

<p>Ascott bowed to the young girl, muttering to himself:
“She’s charming, charming!” But <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, seeming not
to hear the remark, went on, addressing himself to <span lang="fr">Nini</span>:</p>

<p>“Come, don’t be frightened, show you know your manners,
say good-day to the gentleman, offer him your hand!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Nini</span> dropped her eyes, shyly extended her arm, let
Ascott imprison her little hand in his nervous fingers,
which held it a moment or two—perhaps longer than was
quite necessary.</p>

<p>But old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was anxious, as a good uncle should be,
not to make his niece waste her time.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” he declared, smacking a big kiss on her
blushing cheek, “I’m so pleased to have seen you, but you
must run away now, for I suppose you’ve work to do, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied <span lang="fr">Nini</span> in a little soft, childish voice, “I
must be let off to deliver a bodice for the lady on the third
floor, and then I’m to match some things at the shops near
the <span lang="fr">Bourse</span>. But I came to ask you, dear uncle, to come
to dinner with us this evening; mamma will be so pleased.”
<span lang="fr">Moche</span> never moved a muscle as he listened to the little
speech <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span> reeled off, looking her straight in the
eyes and preserving an imperturbable gravity. The old
brigand was lost in wonder; ah! how well the child played
her part, so cutely, so cleverly—with her way of never
looking at Ascott, but all the same contriving to attract
the Englishman’s admiration. Most certainly he would
make something of little <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, never fear!</p>

<p>The bogus uncle and the pseudo-niece took leave of each
other prettily. <span lang="fr">Nini</span> dropped a curtsy as she withdrew,
while Ascott, with shining eyes, bowed to the ground before
her.</p>

<p>Hardly had the charming vision disappeared ere Ascott,
hitherto so frigid and impassive in demeanor, showed a
complete change of attitude, marching up and down <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> office in the throes of a feverish excitement. But
the old scamp pretended not to notice anything, busily
occupied it seemed in sorting his papers. Suddenly he
started round; the Englishman was addressing him. “<span lang="fr">Monsieur
Moche, Monsieur Moche</span>!” he called. Then in hesitating
accents Ascott went on:</p>

<p><a id="png.127" href="#png.127"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>127<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>, you have a niece, <span class="prellips">sir </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and a
devilish pretty girl she is!”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” the old brigand observed, feigning not to
understand the young man’s drift, “it’s true she has fine
eyes, but she’s quite a child <span class="prellips">yet </span><span class="ellips">...</span> the ‘awkward age,’
you <span class="prellips">know </span><span class="ellips">...</span> later on, I don’t say, when she’s developed
a bit; then her good mother and I will find the girl a good
husband.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Moche</span>,” broke in Ascott, “I want to know your niece.”</p>

<p>“But,” returned the villain, still with the same affectation
of <i lang="fr">naïveté</i>, “you do know her, didn’t I introduce you?”</p>

<p>“You are a trifle obtuse, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>, or else a bit
<em>too</em> clever; it’s not in that sense I wish to know her, not I.
Your niece is to my taste; at the present moment I have
no <span class="prellips">mistress </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>The old “advocate” sprang back, feigning the most extravagant
indignation:</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, sir,” he cried, “my dear sir, no, upon my word,
I could never have believed that of you; do you dare to
come to <em>me</em> to make such a proposal? Certainly I’m not
a rich man, and little <span lang="fr">Nini’s</span> sole and only capital is her
virtue and her beauty—it is something, it is a great deal
even—but by the Lord God, I give you my oath, I will
never, never agree to such a bargain. What do you take
me for?”</p>

<p>But Ascott still persisted:</p>

<p>“I take you, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>, for a man of 
<span class="prellips">common-sense </span><span class="ellips">...</span> come now, I or another, what harm can it do
you<span class="ellips">?...</span> while, seeing it <span class="nw">is I——”</span></p>

<p>“But, my dear sir, my dear client,” stammered <span lang="fr">Moche</span>,
who was acting to perfection despair, embarrassment and
perplexity, “but, sir, not you any more than another; my
little niece is still a child, and then, she is an honest girl
and a good and a virtuous; I wouldn’t for anything in all
the <span class="prellips">world </span><span class="ellips">...</span> Besides, just think of it—I, her uncle!”</p>

<p>Ascott interrupted the indignant speaker:</p>

<p>“Come, now, how much?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> seemed overwhelmed by the insult; he sank
into his armchair and took his head between his hands,
vociferating in heartbroken tones and a voice choked with
sobs:</p>

<p>“Why, what sin have I committed that God lets me be
<a id="png.128" href="#png.128"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>128<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>treated in this fashion! I am only a poor advocate, and
my niece just a humble workgirl, but we are both of us—I
should say, all three of us, for I mustn’t forget her sainted
mother—we are all honest folk, worthy of the highest
<span class="prellips">respect </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and we’re expected <span class="prellips">to </span><span class="ellips">...</span> God in
<span class="prellips">heaven </span><span class="ellips">...</span> we’re expected <span class="prellips">to </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> left his sentence unfinished, broke off his peroration
in mid career, for it had become entirely unnecessary.
Peeping through his parted fingers, the old rascal had not
missed a single one of Ascott’s movements. Now the latter,
leaving the old man to finish out his litany of lamentations
by himself, had suddenly quitted the room, banging
the door behind him. This was just what <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was
hoping for; he calculated that the Englishman, seeing
nothing could be made of the uncle, was going to try and
catch up the niece before she had left the house. Treading
softly, he crept to the door giving on the landing outside,
the same Ascott had shut a moment or two before, and
set it ajar. There he stood listening, his face beaming, and
rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>Ascott, who had caught sight of <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span> on the floor
below as he was going downstairs, was leaning over the
bannister and calling in a voice shaking with excitement:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Mademoiselle</span>! pst! <span lang="fr">Mademoiselle</span>, I say! <span lang="fr">Mademoiselle
Eugénie</span>! Listen!”</p>

<p>Then it was <span lang="fr">Nini’s</span> clear, flute-like voice, pitched in a
tone of perfect innocence, that answered:</p>

<p>“Who’s calling me? Is it you, dear uncle?”</p>

<p>Ascott, lowering his voice, and now flying three steps
at a time down the stairs to join the girl below, went on:</p>

<p>“Why, no, <span lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>, so to speak, it’s not just exactly
your uncle, but it’s I, his friend, the gentleman who
was in his office just now. Listen, I’ve something to tell
you; will you let me walk with you?”</p>

<p>Then the two voices mingled in an indistinct murmur,
and the pair could be heard leaving the house.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> went back into his rooms with every sign of profound
satisfaction, skipping about clumsily like a dancing
bear in a merry mood.</p>

<p>“Taken! the bait’s taken fine!” he chuckled, “not a
doubt of it, here’s another stroke of genius to good old
<span lang="fr">Père Moche’s</span> credit!”</p>

 ><small>THE WALL THAT BLED</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc" lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> was busily engaged installing her belongings
in the new flat in the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Evangile</span>, into
which she had moved the previous evening. The girl
possessed a modest stock of furniture of the simplest
possible sort, but on the upkeep of which she lavished the
most fastidious care. For her every piece of furniture,
every article in the rooms, was replete with fond associations.
Since the sinister events that had saddened her
life, since the tragedies of which she had been the heroine,
here were the only things she loved, the only objects that
appealed at once to her memory and her affection. To-day
she was settling in, bent on arranging an interior that
should be to her taste.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday. The weather promised to be magnificent,
and though her windows looked out on the not very
attractive spectacle of the city gasometers, they yet possessed
the enormous advantage of facing no buildings
from which inquisitive or offensive neighbours could overlook
her. The day was bright and cheerful, the air pure
and balmy, and from time to time <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>, choking with
the dust raised by her domestic operations, would go and
lean out of the casement to breathe its freshness. She
was thoroughly enjoying her day of rest; all the week
she was engaged over the books of a big business house in
the gloomy district of <span lang="fr">Aubervilliers</span>.</p>

<p>Her new home in the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Evangile</span> suited her well,
not only because the rooms were pleasant, but also from
the fact of its nearness to the scene of her labours. At the
same time, she had heard within the last few days of a
chance of finding another post that would suit her still
better—a position as cashier in a large restaurant in the
<span lang="fr">Bois de Boulogne</span>. The girl hoped with all her heart that
this possibility might become a reality.</p>

<p><a id="png.130" href="#png.130"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>130<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>But presently the girl’s thoughts turned to graver matters,
and her smooth brow was furrowed with lines of
care and anxiety; her eyes, usually so bright and clear,
darkened in melancholy reverie. It was the look, at once
angry and regretful, that appeared on the girl’s face every
time she remembered <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>; whenever she
thought of the journalist, a sense of disquiet and perplexity
filled her mind. Was she still in love with him? could it
be that she still felt a mysterious passion for the man who
was the author—at least so the unhappy girl was convinced—of
all her misfortunes, the source of the fatal events that
had cast a gloom over all her youth? Was it really possible
that so amiable a young man was the accomplice of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
if not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> himself? For long she had refused
to believe it, but henceforth it was impossible to doubt the
fact; the latest developments, the events that had just
befallen, the violence offered her on the <span lang="fr">Boulevard de
Belleville</span>, confirmed the suspicion beyond all question.</p>

<p>Dreading further persecutions by the monster that seemed
relentlessly bent on her undoing, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> had
experienced a deep sense of satisfaction after her change
of abode, persuaded that an era of peace and tranquility
was now before her. Nevertheless, in excess of caution,
she had charged <span lang="fr">Mme. Doulenques</span>, the concierge of the
house in the <span lang="fr">Rue des Couronnes</span>, not to give her new
address to anyone whatsoever. Moreover, having been
only eight and forty hours installed in her new apartments,
she was not expecting anyone to call.</p>

<p>It was therefore not without considerable perturbation
that suddenly, about two o’clock that afternoon, the girl
heard a violent ring at the bell. Who was it? Who could
be coming to pay her a visit? However, she was somewhat
reassured on recognizing the concierge’s voice calling to her
through the door.</p>

<p>“Mam’zelle, I say, mam’zelle! are you asleep then, or
are you gone deaf? Here’s a good five minutes we’ve
been tugging at your bell!”</p>

<p>On opening the door, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> found herself
confronted not only by the portress, but by a man as well, a
man of forty or thereabouts, with a pleasant, jovial-looking
face. He was dressed in a long-skirted white blouse, and
carried under one arm a half-dozen rolls of paper, while the
<a id="png.131" href="#png.131"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>131<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>other hand held a deep paste-pot with a big brush with a
wooden handle sticking up in it. The workman greeted the
young girl with an almost imperceptible nod of the head,
as she unclosed the door.</p>

<p>“By’r leave, mam’zelle,” he said, “but I’m the painter
and paper-hanger and I’m come from the landlord to
paper your place. Seemingly you want it done?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I do,” the girl answered him, “there’s the
whole of one room wants fresh papering. But,” she added,
“I’m not entitled, am I, to choose the paper?”</p>

<p>The man smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you are, mam’zelle; and, more by token,
I’ve brought patterns!”—adding, with a big laugh, “D’you
suppose I’m going to paper your walls straight away like
that, in less time than it takes to say ‘knife’; you’ve got
to choose, then we’ll try how the thing looks, and then,
when you’ve quite made up your mind, we’ll see about fixing
up the stuff.”</p>

<p>The concierge, seeing her presence was no longer required
and the introductions being duly made, took her departure,
with a word of excuse.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave you now,” the good woman said, “and get
back to my lodge; the fact is, I’ve got ‘company’ this
afternoon.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> led the way into her flat and took the
paper-hanger straight to the room that was to be decorated.
It was the furthest from the entrance-door, the one in
which <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>, the landlord, had had the partition
re-established that had been removed by the previous tenant
to make the two sets into one. The workman displayed
no great anxiety to set to work, and began to ferret about
everywhere and examine the young woman’s furniture in a
rather inquisitorial fashion.</p>

<p>“A sweet, pretty place, this of yours!” he observed,
“quite a little nest for turtle-doves!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> forced a smile: “Oh!” she protested,
“you are mistaken, sir; love is not a happiness I can ever
hope for.”</p>

<p>The workman looked at her with a flattering smile.
“It won’t be your fault, then,” he declared; “a pretty
girl like you can’t <span class="prellips">fail </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> was not in a mood to listen to the
<a id="png.132" href="#png.132"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>132<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>silly speeches the forward fellow might choose to make her.
Not wishing, however, to seem too prim and prudish, she
adroitly turned the conversation:</p>

<p>“How comes it,” she asked, “you’re working on a Sunday?”</p>

<p>“Lord! mam’zelle,” replied the workman, “because I go
on the spree Mondays; but that’s neither here nor there,
we’ve gassed enough, eh? and it’s high time to get to work.”</p>

<p>The man laid the rolls of paper he had brought with him
on the floor, and opened them out one by one, asking the
young lady to make her choice. “D’you prefer the sky-blue
’uns, or the pink, or the light green; there’s some of
all sorts—gay and bright and fresh—like your colour,
mam’zelle!”</p>

<p>But “mam’zelle” took no notice of the compliment, and
fixed her choice on a light blue paper; then, as the paper-hanger
seemed more inclined to gossip than do his work,
she announced:</p>

<p>“I’m going into the next room to put various things in
order; you’ll call me if you want me presently.”</p>

<p>Then something occurred to her of a sudden. “Sir,” she
asked the man, “I have a large picture there, too heavy
for me to manage; if it’s not troubling you, will you be
so kind as to fix it up on the wall?”—to which the workman
agreed readily enough: “With all the pleasure in life,”
he assured her, “you know all I ask is to make myself
agreeable.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> thanked him drily, almost regretting she had
ever asked the favour. The man’s advances rather frightened
her; without quite knowing why, the young girl
felt suspicious and began to wish the fellow gone as soon
as might be. Meantime the workman began to make
hay in the room where he was, a sure sign he was going
to do something at last. <span lang="fr">Mademoiselle Dollon</span> withdrew
into the adjoining room, shutting the door of communication
behind her.</p>

<p>But barely a moment or two had passed since the girl
had left the workman to his own devices when she heard
a heavy crash followed by a terrific oath from the man’s
lips! She dashed to the door and was on the point of
re-entering the room where the paper-hanger was at work,
when the latter sprang forward and prevented her.</p>

<p><a id="png.133" href="#png.133"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>133<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“What now, sir!” she cried, “open the door, I say!”</p>

<p>But from the other side the workman still barred her
entrance: “Don’t come in, mademoiselle, don’t come in!”</p>

<p>“But, after all, what’s happening?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Nothing to do with you, don’t come in!”</p>

<p>“But I insist; the thing’s ridiculous, I’m in my own
house, let me in!”</p>

<p>Then she heard the strange occupant of the room whence
the mysterious noise had come turn the key in the lock,
making any further attempt to force an entrance impossible.
<span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> was more and more terrified.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she ordered, “I must, I <em>will</em> have this door opened,
I wish to know what is the matter, what that noise was.”</p>

<p>But the more excited grew the poor girl, the calmer
became the workman’s voice. He announced composedly:
“I will not open the door, I told you so before, do what
you will!”</p>

<p>In vain the frightened girl shook the locked door, it would
not yield; clearly, a mere waste of strength! What <em>could</em>
be happening within? what was the secret, the tragedy
perhaps, this man of mystery was resolved at all hazards
to conceal?</p>

<p>Driven beyond all patience, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> hurried on
to the landing outside and leaning over the balustrade of
the stairs, at the top of her voice, that rose shrill in panic
and fear, called for: “Help! help! help!!”</p>

<p>Neighbours came running up, surprised and alarmed,
and presently, the girl’s frantic cries still continuing, the
concierge, attracted by the uproar, appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>“Whatever is the matter, my dear?” she demanded—and
in broken accents <span lang="fr">Mademoiselle Dollon</span> told the good
woman her story. The portress was astounded at the
workman’s extraordinary behaviour; she boldly advanced
in her turn, to beat with her heavy fist on the closely
guarded door.</p>

<p>“Open,<!-- TN: comma invisible -->” she vociferated, “open the door! or there’ll be
mischief doing.”</p>

<p>But the calm, slightly sarcastic voice of the individual
who had locked himself within, replied as before: “I will
not open.”</p>

<p>Meantime an impromptu council of war was being held
among the neighbours gathered on the landing:</p>

<p><a id="png.134" href="#png.134"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>134<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Go for the police, that’s the only thing to be done;
it’s a criminal or a madman has locked himself up in there!
We can’t have that poor young girl left alone at his mercy.”</p>

<p>The concierge, firing her last round of ammunition,
threatened the man:</p>

<p>“If you don’t open the door, they’ll go and fetch the
police!”</p>

<p>And the mysterious intruder, in the calmest way, without
so much as raising his voice, replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, go and fetch the police!”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">Some minutes passed, during which this last proposal
was being put into effect.</p>

<p>Presently the heavy footsteps of a sergeant of police
and a constable made themselves heard on the stairs, and
the two representatives of law and order effected a cautious
entry into <span lang="fr">Mademoiselle Dollon’s</span> rooms:</p>

<p>“It is the police,” they announced themselves; “will
you open the door; yes or no?”</p>

<p>They waited a few seconds, then the key turned in the
lock and the door opened softly a little way. The paper-hanger’s
face appeared in the aperture and the man, addressing
the sergeant:</p>

<p>“I will trouble you to step inside, sir,” he said, “queer
things are happening here, your presence is required,” then
added, pointing to the constable: “the other gentleman as
well, perhaps; but no, he might prefer the duty of getting
the ladies out of the way; it is no sight for women.”</p>

<p>The calm, authoritative manner of the workman impressed
the two officers, and the sergeant mechanically ordered
his subordinate:</p>

<p>“Make them move on, please!”</p>

<p>Then the sergeant followed the man into the empty
room with its four blank walls; the latter led the officer
straight to the party-wall that had lately been reconstructed
by the landlord’s orders.</p>

<p>“What do you see there?” he demanded, pointing a
finger at the white surface. The sergeant looked long
and curiously at the spot indicated.</p>

<p>“I see a stain,” he announced at last, “a brown, or is it
a red stain. What does that mean<span class="ellips">?...</span> Are you poking
fun at me? might you be wishing to pull my leg, I wonder.
<a id="png.135" href="#png.135"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>135<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Now, to start with, I call upon you to explain yourself,
why did you refuse to open that door to the young lady
when she asked you?”</p>

<p>The workman shrugged his shoulders: “That’s not the
question in hand,” he said quietly. “What do you think
of that stain? I ought to tell you it made its appearance
immediately after I had made a hole by driving in
a nail.”</p>

<p>“I think nothing,” retorted the sergeant, “except that
all this is nonsensical and incomprehensible balderdash<span class="ellips">....</span>
Yes, and that I am going to take you to the station
for having put the authorities to unnecessary trouble!”</p>

<p>The workman went on smiling: “<em>Unnecessary!</em>” he remarked;
“do you think so?”</p>

<p>To disabuse the sergeant of such an idea, the other
picked up a hammer and started hammering the wall
round the little brown patch; the plaster broke away in
little flakes that crumbled and fell in dust on the floor, and
presently, under the rain of blows, the wall itself showed a
crack. Suddenly a brick tumbled out, and the officer,
who was watching the operation with eyes of amazement,
sprang back with a cry of horror, while even the paper-hanger
himself gave a little start of surprise.</p>

<p>Behind the plaster, in the inside of the wall, which was
of considerable thickness, appeared an appalling sight! It
was a human head, wan and livid, a man’s head with
features streaked and spotted by the discolorations of
death!</p>

<p>The sergeant gazed at the workman in indescribable
agitation. “What is it?” he asked, “what is it? I call
upon you to tell me what it is?”</p>

<p>“It is a dead man, no doubt of that—a dead man they’ve
walled up in that wall, there can be no doubt of that either!”</p>

<p>“But in that case,” exclaimed the sergeant, “it must
be a question of crime, murder! It is a most grave and
serious matter; the Commissary must be advised!”</p>

<p>The mysterious workman bowed: “I am entirely of your
opinion,” he said, “the presence of the Commissary appears
to me to be indispensable.”</p>

<p>The sergeant, quite beside himself, ran to the outer door,
where his subordinate was keeping good guard.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Japuzot</span>!” he ordered, “run quick to the station and
<a id="png.136" href="#png.136"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bring the chief. I have discovered a crime. I have just
found it is a question of murder!”</p>

<p>Meantime a confused clamour came from the crowd
still thronging the landing, at the top of the stairs. <span lang="fr">Elisabeth
Dollon</span>, who had remained transfixed with terror in
the outer room, was for coming to see what was happening.
Opportunely enough the sergeant stopped her.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are, <span lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>,” he ordered, “it is
not a sight for a young lady; the concierge will bear you
company.”</p>

<p>Then, as the gallant officer did not wish the place to be
invaded by the curious crowd, nor yet to lose sight of the
dubious individual within, he shut to the outer door of the
flat. Leaving the people on the landing to their divers
conjectures, he returned to the gruesome room, where the
paper-hanger still remained. The latter was seated quietly
on the floor, for there were no chairs in the room, and had
lit a cigarette, and now, with the utmost composure, offered
one to the sergeant.</p>

<p>“There’s a bad smell,” he remarked, “it’s the corpse;
will you smoke?”</p>

<p>The sergeant, dumbfounded by the man’s calmness in
presence of such tragic happenings, could not manage to light
his cigarette; his lips were as tremulous as his hands. At
last, at the third or fourth attempt, he succeeded; but he
had not taken half a dozen puffs when his sense of discipline
made him suddenly toss his cigarette out of the
window. A peremptory ring had just sounded at the outer
door, and the sergeant at once inferred it was the “chief”
demanding admittance.</p>

<p>He was right. The Commissary, a little, fat man, with
an imposing corporation, dashed forward out of breath,
hustling everybody to right and left, and hurried into the
ill-omened room. His eyes fell first on the grim head
that looked out, an image of horror, from the wall where
it was imbedded. Then he turned to stare at the paper-hanger,
who without the smallest show of respect towards
the magistrate, remained sitting on the floor, still smoking
with imperturbable aplomb.</p>

<p>The magistrate demanded: “What’s to do here? Who
are you? who is the man? how does he come there?
what have you to say to it, yourself?”</p>

<p><a id="png.137" href="#png.137"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>137<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“There!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘<em>there</em>’?”</p>

<p>“There,” the paper-hanger concluded his sentence:
“there’s what you want to know about, before your eyes.”</p>

<p>The Commissary was boiling with impatience.</p>

<p>“Why, of course I want to know. What’s been happening?
How was this extraordinary discovery made?”</p>

<p>The workman, getting to his feet at last: “I would
point out to you, <span lang="fr">Monsieur le Commissaire</span>,” he protested,
“that it is not my business, but rather yours, to find out
all this! None the less, I am very willing to help you and
give you my co-operation.”</p>

<p>Going up to the wall, the workman began, with little
measured taps, to break away the plaster round the dead
man’s head. As he worked, he explained:</p>

<p>“Driving a nail just now into the wall here, I saw drops
of blood ooze out—a wall that bleeds is not a common
sight—and before pushing my investigations further, I had
the police sent for. Directly on your sergeant’s arrival, I
brought to light the unfortunate man’s head. We have
waited out of respect for your authority before carrying
the investigation further. But, now you are come, <span lang="fr">Monsieur
le Commissaire</span>, I don’t think there’s anything need
prevent our bringing to light the rest of the poor fellow’s
body.”</p>

<p>The magistrate gave a twist to his moustache and
acquiesced. “Proceed with your work,” he directed, and
the workman took up his hammer again. With a few
rapid blows, he brought down the rest of the party-wall,
and the unhappy victim’s body was revealed in its entirety.
It was a gruesome spectacle! A human being had been
walled up there. The body had previously been coated with
quicklime, and the extremities were already burnt away.
Still, the general aspect of the corpse was more or less
intact. At the nape of the neck the dead man had a huge
bruise, now quite black, and forming, at the top of the
vertebræ, a great ball full of extravasated blood.</p>

<p>The victim wore a uniform, easily recognized, the familiar
long, blue frock-coat with silver buttons of the collectors
in the service of the big credit houses. While the Commissary
stood motionless, rooted to the spot, the workman
had gone closer, and had cast a rapid glance at the inscription
<a id="png.138" href="#png.138"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>138<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>engraved on the buttons of the uniform. Next moment
he announced the result of his scrutiny:</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Comptoir National<span class="ellips">!...</span></i> there can be no doubt about
it, <span lang="fr">Monsieur le Commissaire</span>; the man is the collector of
the <span lang="fr">Comptoir National</span> who was murdered, hardly ten days
ago, in the house in the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>!”</p>

<p>“But—but,” stammered the Commissary, “how does
the body come to be here?”</p>

<p>The paper-hanger urged suggestively:</p>

<p>“The house in the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span> where the crime
was committed and the house in the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Evangile</span>
where we discover the corpse, belong to the same landlord,
the business agent trading under the name of <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>.”</p>

<p>The Commissary started violently: “<span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>! I
will have him <span class="prellips">arrested </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“You would be making a mistake!” the paper-hanger
interrupted the magistrate.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because, if <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> was the murderer, he would
never have been so imprudent as to hide his victim’s body
in a house belonging to himself. Besides, there are other
people to <span class="prellips">suspect </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“Why? Who?”</p>

<p>“Gad, sir!” declared the workman, “perhaps the individual
from whom the bank messenger took up his last
payment—one <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> by name. Perhaps, again, the working
mason who built that wall?”</p>

<p>“Who was the man?” questioned the Commissary.</p>

<p>“It is not for me to tell you, but for you to find
him!”</p>

<p>The Commissary stood puzzling his brains, while the
workman went on:</p>

<p>“Then, again, there’s an individual open to suspicion on
several counts, the man <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> lodged for forty-eight
hours in his garret in the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>, who seized
the opportunity to kill two police-officers who were coming
to arrest him!”</p>

<p>“You accuse the journalist, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, of the bank
<span lang="fr">employé’s</span> murder?”</p>

<p>The workman shrugged his shoulders: “I accuse nobody,”
he protested, “I form hypotheses, and that’s all;
<a id="png.139" href="#png.139"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>139<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><span class="prellips">I </span><span class="ellips">...</span> my part, in fact, is not to bring accusations, but
<span class="prellips">simply </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>The Commissary, exasperated by these repeated suppressions,
this reticence on the part of his interlocutor,
suddenly came up to the workman and clapping both hands
on his shoulder:</p>

<p>“This is all mighty mysterious,” he complained, “now,
for a start, you are going to tell me what you are doing
here?”</p>

<p>“You can see for yourself I am a painter and paper-hanger,
I came to put up papers.”</p>

<p>“Put up papers! on a Sunday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <span lang="fr">Monsieur le Commissaire</span>.”</p>

<p>“On a Sunday!—that won’t wash! And besides, you
strike me as a mighty hard-headed chap. This crime is
out of all ordinary—you show no surprise. This discovery
is appalling—you never turn a hair! My lad, you make
out too <span class="prellips">well </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“Must a man be an imbecile because he’s a working man?”</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">Commissaire</span> checked himself, vexed at his own want
of tact: “I don’t mean to say that, but still I find you
a puzzle. You make your appearance here a short hour
ago, you knock in a nail, the wall bleeds, you knock away
the plaster covering the masonry and the corpse comes
to light! You wait for the police to come to explain the
crime. What have you to say for yourself?”</p>

<p>“Nothing!” the workman shook his head.</p>

<p>The Commissary was getting more and more annoyed:
“I really do not know,” he blustered, “what stops me from
arresting you.”</p>

<p>At this, the workman, suddenly assuming a sly look,
looked his companion up and down:</p>

<p>“What stops you from arresting me? why, nothing!
But what will stop your doing it, I’m going to tell <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“Tell me then!”</p>

<p>“<span class="prellips">This </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>” and the mysterious workman with a quick
movement, stripped off his blouse, and, beneath his working
garment, he appeared elegantly attired in a dark blue
suit; he wore a silk neckerchief of a quiet, gentlemanly cut
and colour, a collar of immaculate whiteness. Removing
his cap, which till then had been pulled well down over his
<a id="png.140" href="#png.140"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>140<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ears, he displayed a broad, intellectual forehead; his hair
was of a light blonde, sprinkled with silvery threads at the
temples.</p>

<p>Without giving a thought to the intense surprise he had
created, the <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> workman looked the Commissary
hard in the eyes, as he declared gravely:</p>

<p>“I am Tom Bob, American detective; a week ago I
arrived in Paris, having crossed the Atlantic with the
express purpose of tracking down <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> and effecting
his arrest!”—adding courteously: “<span lang="fr">Monsieur le Commissaire</span>,
I am grateful to circumstances that have afforded
me the pleasure of making your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>So saying, the detective—for it was no other—made
slowly for the door and was about to leave the room,
when the Commissary called him back:</p>

<p>“Sir, what is this you tell me? You are Tom Bob?”</p>

<p>“Do you require proofs of the fact, sir?”</p>

<p>The magistrate begged pardon: “No, no, certainly not!
I have no doubt whatever of your identity; indeed I have
seen portraits of you, I recognise you perfectly well. But
I wanted to ask you one thing—you think this is a crime
of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?”</p>

<p>Tom Bob threw out his arms in a wide gesture: “With
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, can one ever tell? but to be quite frank
with you, I do <em>not</em> think so; and you may rest assured I
have my reasons for holding that <span class="prellips">opinion </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span lang="fr">Monsieur
le Commissaire</span>, your servant!”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Bob!”</p>

<p>“Well, sir? you have something else to say to me?”</p>

<p>The Commissary, growing more and more embarrassed,
stammered out:</p>

<p>“<span class="prellips">Yes </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span class="prellips">no </span><span class="ellips">...</span> in <span class="prellips">fact </span><span class="ellips">...</span> at any <span class="prellips">rate </span><span class="ellips">...</span><!-- TN: original has four dots but the first isn't a period -->
You are going off like that? and leaving me alone<span class="ellips">?...</span>
But the corpse<span class="ellips">?...</span> and suppose I wanted you?”</p>

<p>The American drew a card from his pocket-book and
offered it to the Commissary:</p>

<p>“I have told you my name; it is Tom Bob; I am
staying at the <span lang="fr">Hôtel Terminus</span>; if ever French justice has
need of me, it will always find me at its disposition.”</p>

<p>The Commissary had not recovered from his general
state of bewilderment when Tom Bob disappeared.</p>

 ><small>IN THE <span lang="fr">BOIS DE BOULOGNE</span></small></h2>


<p class="noindent">“<span class="smc">You</span> appear to me, my dear fellow, to be enjoying yourself
just like the fashionable folk, and you are the most
ungrateful chap on earth to go on talking about ‘the
cruelty of Fate’ and ‘the stings of Fortune’ and a heap
of other unpleasant things. After all said and done, what
is your present outlook? It is the month of May, surely,
it is ten in the evening, the scene is as pretty as a picture,
the night warm and fragrant, in one word it is the hour
when the restaurants in the <span lang="fr">Bois</span> are crammed with gay
customers, the hour when it is exquisite to sup beneath
the budding foliage, to roam the deserted walks, to saunter
in this magnificent <span lang="fr">Bois de Boulogne</span>, a park such as no
other capital in the world possesses. Now, what have you
been doing? what are you going to do? Halloa, my friend,
I feel something in your pocket, hard and crumbly at the
same time, that gives me all the impression of a crust
of bread. So you’ve been dining in the <span lang="fr">Bois</span>, my lad!
And now what do you propose to do? Walk round the
lake? Evidently you’ve forgotten your carriage and you’re
going on foot; evidently again there’s every chance that,
an hour from now, it won’t be a little, stuffy hotel you go
back to, but the vast <i lang="fr">caravansérail</i> that is lit by the stars
of heaven. Still, you’re beginning your evening the same
as the fashionables—dinner, promenade! And what’s to
stop you dreaming, like any other innocent, that you are
destined to-night to wed the fairest princess in all the
world.”</p>

<p>The person holding this discourse, so full of a philosophic
optimism, was no other than <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>. The journalist
was talking to himself, having indeed nobody near
him to whom he could address his moralizings. As he
had observed, it was about ten o’clock; it was a superb
night, and taking everything together, the young man
<a id="png.142" href="#png.142"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>142<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>would not have been greatly to be pitied for finding himself
in the <span lang="fr">Bois de Boulogne</span> and about to take an agreeable
stroll, if, as again he had remarked, the walk in question
had not been bound to end in his passing this night in true
vagabond style in some thicket or other of the park, at
the imminent risk of being taken up by the police, who
are invariably very strict with poor devils guilty of the
heinous crime of not being rich and sleeping out of doors!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the journalist’s condition showed
no improvement. Since his interview with Tom Bob, he
had had no occasion to renew acquaintance with the American
detective, who, as the object of a hundred flattering
attentions on the part of the Parisian population, seemed
to him, all things considered, a decidedly dangerous personage
to see much of, in view of the close relations maintained
between him and the authorities. <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was now making
a living by all sorts of queer odd jobs—risking his life
opening carriage doors on the occasion of grand weddings
at fashionable churches, of selling evening papers on the
boulevards, picking up a few sous by casual labour at
the <span lang="fr">Halles</span>, just enough to keep body and soul together.
Nevertheless, he would not have been over and above disquieted
by his precarious situation but for the fact that
public opinion had little by little come round to the preposterous
belief that he, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, was, if not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
at any rate one of the chief accomplices of that dangerous
criminal, now a prisoner in the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite>. This easy, blockhead
theory the whole police force had adopted, and every
journal was proclaiming.</p>

<p>At a time when <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, with unheard-of effrontery,
was committing crime after crime, when the most appalling
murders had grown so common that the public, seriously
alarmed, were asking themselves if it was not best to pay
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> the tithes he claimed, at such a time <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
told himself that the view which represented him as the
guilty party had every chance of finding favour, just
because it possessed the merit of being simple to the last
degree!</p>

<p>“Once let them catch me,” he thought, “and it’ll be
short shrift and no mercy for me!”</p>

<p>Accordingly, every night, while waiting events and looking
confidently for the result of Tom Bob’s inquiries,
<a id="png.143" href="#png.143"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>143<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> would betake himself to the <span lang="fr">Bois</span>, and there spend
the night, if not in comfort, at any rate, so at least he
hoped, safe from the perquisitions of the Criminal Investigation
officers.</p>

<p>But what precisely was Tom Bob doing? On what
lines was he pursuing his investigations against <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?
As to this, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was very much in the dark. Like the
general public, he had read in the newspapers of the
sensational discovery of the bank collector’s body which
the American detective had succeeded in making in <span lang="fr">Elisabeth
Dollon’s</span> flat. <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, like everybody else, more
perhaps than most, for he knew the difficulties that beset
police researches, had felt a profound admiration for the
astuteness the American had given proof of on that occasion.</p>

<p>“No doubt,” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> said to himself, “I put him on the
scent when I told him about <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, but all said and
done, I had no information to give him of a sort to lead
him to the discovery of the victim. The line of reasoning
that took him to <span lang="fr">Elisabeth’s</span>, that brought about the finding
of the ‘wall that bleeds,’ after rousing his suspicions of
<span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, this reasoning was purely his own and it is marvellous
in all respects.”</p>

<p>He had even added in his self-communings:</p>

<p>“If my fine fellow goes on as he has begun, I verily
believe <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> will have found his match!”</p>

<p>It was the sole gleam of hope still left to <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">“Ho there! my man.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">M’sieu?</span>”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean, strolling about like that? You’re
a gentleman of means, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, <span lang="fr">m’sieu</span>, I’m strolling <span class="prellips">because </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“Right oh! D’ye care to earn six sous an hour? you
know how to hold a shovel?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <span lang="fr">m’sieu</span>; yes, I’m willing.”</p>

<p>“Come with me then!”</p>

<p>The man who had hailed <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, as the journalist was
finishing his circuit of the lake and had now reached the
Racing Club enclosure, was evidently a roadman of the
city of Paris. He wore the flat, silver-laced cap of the
roads department, he had the heavy gait of an <span lang="fr">employé</span>
in that service, and the same good-natured look:</p>

<p><a id="png.144" href="#png.144"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>144<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“If I take you on,” he explained, leading <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
towards the further end of the lake, near the <span lang="fr">Rond Royal</span>,
“it’s along of a pressing job, for to-morrow’s fête. I want
hands.”</p>

<p>“There’s a fête to-morrow?” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> asked.</p>

<p>“And a smart one, I can tell you, my lad! a fête on the
lake in honour of I don’t know what good Dutch folks,
who are paying an official visit to Paris. Seems they’re
going to take ’em on the water. It’s the municipality
gives the show. Now I got my notice only just in time;
so I’ve not been able to get my men together, and I’m glad
enough to find outsiders like you to give a hand.”</p>

<p>“What is it you want done?” queried <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, delighted
at the opportunity that offered of earning a few sous.</p>

<p>“You’ll soon see,” the other replied with a shrug. “It’s
not difficult and it’s not fatiguing. At this end of the
road coming from the <span lang="fr">Pré Catalan</span>—you know, the road
that joins the one round the lake yonder—we’re removing
the wire fencing that divides the avenue from the grass
lawns that border the lake all round. We’re taking up
the curb of the roadway, too. The turf’s to be dug up
and laid down again at the sides; in fact, we’re making
a road, so to say, going straight down to the water’s edge,
so as the grandees may get out of their carriages at the
very same spot where they’re to get into the boats. You
see, don’t you, we couldn’t begin the works yesterday evening,
nor yet this morning, nor even this afternoon, because
that would block the regular road.”</p>

<p>What cared <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> for these details? He followed
the head roadman and soon reached the roadway
that was to be carried on right up to the very edge of the
lake. There, by the light of acetylene lamps fixed on tall
standards, a whole crew of labourers was busily engaged.</p>

<p>“Stand to!” shouted the ganger, “I’m bringing you a
new chum, find him some easy work.” A second ganger
came running up, and looked <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> up and down, then:</p>

<p>“You’re not a roadman? no? You don’t understand
gardening, neither? so much the worse! I am going to
use you for digging up the road then. Come this way.”
He led <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> to the middle of the causeway that goes
round the lake.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he explained, “so’s to lengthen out the
<a id="png.145" href="#png.145"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>145<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>roadway, we take up the turf of the lawn, using a spade—very
carefully so’s not to spoil it. We’re going to sand
over and beat flat and so make a bit of road down to the
lake; but as the carriages will arrive from the <span lang="fr">Pré Catalan</span>,
where tea’s to be served at five o’clock, it’s not worth
while, you see, to leave the road that circles the lake still
practicable. Accordingly, we take the turf lifted from
over there and lay it down all across the lake road. As
the sods are lifted carefully one by one, it’s only a question
of laying ’em one beside the other, a drop of water and the
grass’ll look quite green. That’ll give the impression, not
that a new way has been specially opened down to the
lake, but rather that the regular road from the Pré Catalan
continues straight on to the water’s edge, passing through
a grass-plot, the ordinary grass-plot, the one we are now
after extending.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> nodded his comprehension and waiting till the
other had finished, asked:</p>

<p>“Then <em>my</em> job is to pick up the sods and lay ’em down
side by side across the road round the lake? so as to
extend the grass lawn?”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket, my lad! and try to work lively,
won’t you?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had been at work ten minutes when another
man, an engineer most likely, appeared from behind a
clump of trees; he was elegantly, yet quietly dressed.
Hailing one of the gangers:</p>

<p>“You’ve got men enough now?” he asked.</p>

<p>The other looked doubtful: “H’m; it’s a near thing,
especially as we’ve got to be finished by midnight! I’ve
had to enlist casual labour—chaps that were getting ready
for a night under the trees. There’s nothing wrong about
that, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Let me have a look at them!”</p>

<p>A second or two later the ganger who had enlisted
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> came up to the journalist, who was working away
very hard and conscientiously, all alone, away from the other
roadmen. He stared at him for a minute without a word.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how to work, my man,<!-- TN: comma invisible -->” he said at
last, “it’s not worth twopence, what you’re doing!”</p>

<p>“But, sir,” protested <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, very much surprised;
“I’m doing my best.”</p>

<p><a id="png.146" href="#png.146"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>146<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Well, then, your best’s not good enough; you’re
not getting on!” Then, as if coming to a sudden
decision:</p>

<p>“No, you’re no good at all and now the chief has been
jawing me for taking on outsiders. Here, here’s forty
sous; clear out!”</p>

<p>There was nothing to be said; moreover, the instant he
had fingered his forty sous, a fortune in his present plight,
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> lost all interest in the work on hand, good, bad or
indifferent.</p>

<p>“Right you are, sir!” was all he said, “I’m off; many
thanks all the same”—and slipping the two franc piece
in his pocket, he walked away, pursued by the foreman’s
scrutinizing and suspicious gaze.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he disappeared before the engineer—it was
evidently he who had ordered his dismissal—again appeared
from among the shadows. He advanced to the shore of
the lake, nodding familiarly to the men working there, and
on reaching the water’s edge, gave a shrill, short, sharp
whistle, then stood quite still, waiting. The night was
dark, without moon or stars. In a few seconds after he
had blown his whistle, there showed up on the dark waters
of the lake a shadowy, fantastic shape. It was indistinctly
seen at first, but it approached so rapidly that very soon
it became easy to make out what it was—a boat of rubber,
a collapsible boat such as explorers use. A man was on
board, rowing silently and soundlessly. Soon the figure
grew plainer and its outline could be vaguely discerned,
the boat was entering the zone illuminated by the acetylene
flares.</p>

<p>Then the mysterious rower rose to his feet. What would
<span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> feelings have been, had he been there to see?
The man who stood in this mysterious craft, who was
approaching this scene of impromptu road-making, issuing
from the impenetrable shadows of the lake, was clad from
head to foot in a suit of black-close-fitting tights. His
shoulders were draped in a dark cloak, the face was invisible
behind a cowl, a black mask!</p>

<p>A figure of horror, a very incarnation of crime, a form
of terror without a name! It was the form of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
come in the night to inspect the work of the roadmen
engaged in preparations for to-morrow’s fête!</p>

<p class="thtbk"><!-- TN: thoughtbreak inferred: pagebreak only in original --><a id="png.147" href="#png.147"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>147<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><br class="ns">The hour was divine, the scene fascinating in its charm
and seduction, at once sumptuous and refined. Nor was
the setting less delightful, this elegant restaurant, this
favourite haunt of fashion, where the invited guests one
and all belonged to the wealthy aristocracy of Paris; supper
was drawing to an end, the talk grew more brilliant than
ever, the music was ravishing, the women lovely, the perfumes
intoxicating, the flowers a feast for the eyes! No
less than everything else the mysterious hues of the foliage,
a weird tint of blue painted by the gleam of the electric
lights, contributed to lend this corner of the <span lang="fr">Bois</span> a look
of unreality, a fairylike aspect like some fantastic scene on
the stage, charming, delicious, entrancing!</p>

<p>This evening the place was even more brilliantly lighted
than usual. The papers had made much of the coming
festivity; in celebration of a treaty of Commerce signed
the previous week, the English Ambassador was paying
this compliment to his colleague the Ambassador of Russia.
Dinner was served at separate little tables. It was past
midnight, the meal was almost over and conversation was
more animated than ever.</p>

<p>Apart from the other guests, at a table set at a distance
from the others, sat dining quite alone a very beautiful
woman, of an irreproachable elegance and one who, better
still than Sonia Danidoff, could claim the rank of Royal
Highness. The waiters named her to each other with
baited breath: “Her Highness the Grand Duchess Alexandra.”
It was in fact the haughty great lady, friend of
Frederick Christian IV, King of <span lang="de">Hesse-Weimar</span>, the proud
lady whom <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, and they alone, knew to be
in reality the enigmatic Lady Beltham, the mistress of
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!</p>

<p>And truly, if some observer had chosen to watch the
pretty woman in question, he would have shuddered to
note with what a look, at once tragic and distraught, full
of hate and violent animosity, she gazed at her gay and
laughing neighbours, the guests of the Ambassadors of
England and of Russia. It would seem indeed that the
grand duchess had some secret motive for wishing to remain
unseen by these members of Parisian society. Not content
with choosing a remote table enveloped in deep shadow,
she had likewise extinguished the little electric table lamp
<a id="png.148" href="#png.148"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>148<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in front of her; the light thrown by the surrounding lamps
was sufficient for her to see by. All through her meal
the grand duchess sat pale and mute, barely answering the
<i lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</i> who hovered near, eager to supply her
wants, her eyes fixed on the other diners, from whose
tables came burst after burst of merry laughter.</p>

<p>Already the grand duchess was thinking of taking her
departure when of a sudden, as if drawn by some surprising
vision, she half sprang up, then with a quick recoil threw
herself back into the shadows, as though terrified and yet
more anxious than before to shun observation. Bowing
low in courteous greeting to one and another acquaintance,
a man of slim, well-knit figure and elegant bearing had
joined the circle formed by the official guests. His name
passed from lip to lip, and he was welcomed with a chorus
of friendly and admiring exclamations, sometimes marked
by just a touch of raillery:</p>

<p>“Tom Bob! why how late you are. What, have you
been hunting till this hour of the night for your strange
enemy, the ever evasive <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?”</p>

<p>But while the sound of that dreaded name still broke
the stillness of the summer evening, while the Grand
Duchess Alexandra, Lady Beltham in reality, still shuddered
to hear her lover’s name pronounced, gaiety quickly
resumed its sway among the other guests.</p>

<p>“My dear,” remarked a tall young woman, a trifle
eccentric in appearance and manner, a Russian who, report
said, had been involved in a highly diverting scandal,
“My dear, you are sad?” But the Princess Sonia Danidoff,
to whom the words were spoken, shook her head with a
smile:</p>

<p>“No, you are mistaken; I am not sad, but I am
thinking.”</p>

<p>“Thinking of what?”</p>

<p>At the little table where the two pretty women were
conversing, there sat, among several <i lang="fr">attachés</i> of the Embassies,
the wealthy young Englishman, Mr. Ascott, who
now followed up the question addressed to the beautiful
princess.</p>

<p>“Princess,” he said, “we cannot long allow you to remain
so self-absorbed, so serious, on so lovely a night as this
and at so delightful a fête.”</p>

<p><a id="png.149" href="#png.149"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>149<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>A smile of raillery curled Sonia Danidoff’s lips; with a
touch of impatience, a suspicion of mockery, she replied:</p>

<p>“So, sir, if you can prevent my being sad, for it appears
I <em>am</em> sad, I gladly give you my permission to try. But
I am very much afraid you will find it difficult to make me
merry.”</p>

<p>“That depends,” returned the Englishman; “tell us,
if it may be, the wish you have in your mind. All here,
I make bold to say, are gallant gentlemen. At the risk
of attempting the impossible, we will use every effort to
give it satisfaction. I even notice by the smile on my
friend Tom Bob’s face, and you know a police-officer
rarely smiles, he admits that to please you nothing is
impossible. It is a guarantee that, if we fail in our desire
to banish your depression, it will be no fault of ours.”</p>

<p>The Princess Danidoff was opening her lips to reply
when her friend stopped her.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” she said, “I think Sonia will forgive me
for my indiscretion, if I betray the secret of her melancholy;
Sonia Danidoff, kinswoman of the Tsar, enormously rich,
pretty enough to make all the women on this earth jealous,
Sonia Danidoff, good sirs, is preoccupied simply and solely
because she <span class="prellips">is </span><span class="ellips">...</span> bored! Nay, do not protest; it is
not that your society has displeased her! But Sonia, I
know, finds life flat, stale and unprofitable; Sonia dreams
of a great passion, of romantic love, such love as is hardly
to be found in our times, such as she has hardly a chance
of inspiring. And so Sonia is profoundly homesick. Now
you are fairly warned!” With a wave of her slim, white
hand: “Never believe that scatterbrain,” the princess protested;
“I am not <span class="prellips">so </span><span class="ellips">...</span> romantic.”</p>

<p>A burst of laughter had greeted the statements of the
young Russian; now all were listening to a charming, an
exquisite Neapolitan boat-song.</p>

<p>But Tom Bob’s attention was not with the music. Quitting
his seat—it was nearly two in the morning and the
men were trifling with Egyptian cigarettes—he had come
to lean over the back of the fair princess’s chair.</p>

<p>“Princess,” he was saying, “why do you refuse to seek
a love a little more original, which means a little more
real, than that commonly met with? <em>I</em> do not think that
so absurd a quest.”</p>

<p><a id="png.150" href="#png.150"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>150<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>In an instant those wondrous eyes of the Princess Sonia
Danidoff’s lit up, shining with a deep, soft radiance. She
half turned round to look at the speaker, that amazing
Tom Bob whose doughty deeds filled the Press, that wily
detective, that hero.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she made answer, “you speak strangely. So
you believe in love?”</p>

<p>“I do, madam,” replied the American, “and the more
profoundly, and it may be the more sadly, as this very
evening I have been a witness of the birth of two sentiments,
one a half indifferent attraction, the other a genuine
passion.”</p>

<p>“What reason for sadness in that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Every reason, for I am much afraid that these two
sentiments will end in sadness and disillusionment.”</p>

<p>For a moment the princess sat silent, puzzled, hesitating.
At last she spoke with an affectation of haughtiness such
as every woman knows how to assume:</p>

<p>“I do not understand you very well, sir. You speak in
riddles. I am a Russian, you an American. I beg you
use some other dialect than Parisian ‘blague’; be more
explicit.”</p>

<p>With a quick glance, Tom Bob made sure there was
no listener to pay heed to his talk with the fascinating
princess. The Neapolitan singers had been succeeded by
a bevy of quaint step-dancers, whom all the company was
attentively watching.</p>

<p>Reassured on this point, Tom Bob, intoxicated perhaps
by the beauty of the night, perhaps crazed by Sonia
Danidoff’s loveliness, charmed no doubt by the sympathy
she had never ceased to lavish on him throughout this
after-dinner talk, resolved to burn his boats:</p>

<p>“You do not understand, madam,” he resumed, “you
surprise me! I imagine you have not failed to notice the
marked attentions, to say no more, paid you by our common
friend, M. Ascott? Oh! never deny it, madam!
To-night, as indeed he does habitually, M. Ascott has made
the most determined efforts to win your favour.”</p>

<p>There was almost a touch of mockery in the words, and
Sonia Danidoff was too quick-witted not to catch the
other’s drift.</p>

<p>“It would seem,” she said, “these efforts do not strike
<a id="png.151" href="#png.151"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>151<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>you, sir, as having been crowned with success! you think
my conquest is not an accomplished fact yet?”</p>

<p>“I do not think, <span class="prellips">madam </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <em>I hope</em>.”</p>

<p>And with these two little words which meant so much,
which were equivalent to the most formal of declarations,
Tom Bob, like a well-advised suitor, aware that a man
must never demand an answer but always wait till it is
offered, made his bow to the princess and walked away.</p>

<p>“I am going to call your carriage,” he said.</p>

<p>The company was, in fact, rising from table; it was
growing very chilly and the time was come to think of
quitting the <span lang="fr">Bois</span> for the city. Everywhere the guests
were exchanging farewells, then the women of fashion,
escorted by their <i lang="fr">cavaliere servente</i>, made for their elegant
broughams or sumptuous automobiles. All were leaving,
and leaving all at the same time, to return together as far
as the barrier of the <span lang="fr">Porte Dauphine</span>, when the final <span lang="fr">adieux</span>
would be exchanged.</p>

<p>All together? No, not so. There was one fair lady, at
any rate, who did not intend to make one of the merry
crowd. Indeed, the Grand Duchess Alexandra showed
not the slightest desire to quit the table at which she had
sat from the very beginning of the evening, isolated, sullen
almost! She had never ceased her watch of the official
guests, and above all had not failed to mark the flattering
attentions and manifestations of sympathy lavished everywhere
on Tom Bob. Now her eyes were fixed askance
on the Princess Sonia Danidoff, the acknowledged queen
of the festivity, as she took the arm the detective offered.
The white teeth of the Grand Duchess Alexandra were
nervously biting her lip. The noble lady was doubtless
thinking with acute agitation how she was the mistress
of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> and that this hero of the hour was the
very same man who had sworn to bring her lover to the
scaffold!</p>

<p>But it was high time to be gone, and the grand duchess
summoned her <i lang="fr">chasseur</i>.</p>

<p>“Call up my car,” she ordered, “but tell my chauffeur
he is carefully to avoid returning with the rest of the
company; he is to drive by the less frequented roads. I do
not care to be compelled to greet all these folks, who,
luckily, have so far neither seen nor recognized me.”</p>

<p><a id="png.152" href="#png.152"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>152<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The menial bowed and went his way, but he was back
again next minute.</p>

<p>“Your Highness’s chauffeur,” he said, “has to inform your
Highness that an accident has happened to the car; he is
busy repairing the damage, but it will take a good half-hour.
Your Highness does not wish me to go for a hired
carriage?”</p>

<p>The Grand Duchess Alexandra, or rather Lady Beltham,
seemed to hesitate a few moments. She cast a dark and
venomous look of suddenly awakened anger in the direction
of the last lingering guests mounting their vehicles, then
quickly:</p>

<p>“No, I am in no hurry. Tell the chauffeur to do the
repairs, and come and tell me when all’s ready”—and the
footman vanished once more.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">“You are infinitely obliging, madam, to offer to drive
me back to Paris. Instead of sitting sad and solitary in a
hired conveyance, it is no small happiness for me to journey
a few minutes in your company and enjoy, with no unbearable
third party present, the favour you are so amiable
as to show me.”</p>

<p>In fact, as Sonia Danidoff was on the way to her limousine,
hanging on Tom Bob’s arm, the princess had observed
that the latter, having no conveyance of his own, would
be obliged to get back to Paris alone as best he might,
and there and then she had made the offer: “Come, won’t
you get into my car? You can drive with me to the house,
then they’ll set you down at your destination.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob, needless to say, jumped at the offer, delighted
to seize the opportunity of so charming a <i lang="fr">tête à tête</i>.
And soon the princess and he were talking amicably together,
while their car sped through the deserted <span lang="fr">Bois</span>
along the road, lit up for a dozen yards ahead by the glare
of the acetylene lamps on the bonnet. They talked, let it
be said, of indifferent subjects, the American carefully
avoiding any reference, however casual, to the declaration
of love he had ventured to make a moment before, and
Sonia feigning not to have understood his meaning.</p>

<p>“You have a wonderfully fine car, madam,” observed
Tom Bob, as the princess’s chauffeur, making a clever turn
and taking advantage of the exceptional speed of the
<a id="png.153" href="#png.153"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>153<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>car, took the head of the procession formed by the different
cars. “<!-- TN: opening quote invisible -->We shall be there in a few seconds; I shall be sorry
for that, madam.”</p>

<p>“<span class="prellips">You </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But at the very instant Sonia Danidoff was in act to
reply, a cry of horror and anguished fear escaped her lips,
while for his part, Tom Bob could hardly restrain a
startled oath.</p>

<p>What had happened? Impossible for the occupants
of the cars to perceive in the bewilderment of the moment!
What blunder had the chauffeur made to provoke the
accident? Suddenly, without any diminution of speed,
without even any application of the brakes to slow up
the pace, the four first cars following the road from the
<span lang="fr">Pré Catalan</span> had plunged into the lake of the <span lang="fr">Bois de
Boulogne</span>!</p>

<p>Fortunately the lake is not very deep. Still, the danger
was serious that confronted those who found themselves
thus involved in so sudden a shipwreck. The women were
muffled in their cloaks, the men hampered with their
great coats; moreover, the cars had been pitched almost one
on top of the other, and cries of terrified bewilderment rose
on all sides.</p>

<p>Inside Sonia’s limousine events followed each other with
dramatic swiftness. Tom Bob, a marvel of presence of
mind, a miracle of coolness, had not lost his head for an
instant. The moment the princess broke off to scream,
the moment he felt the ground slip from under the wheels,
he realized what was happening. In a flash he concluded
at first that the princess’s driver, deceived by the darkness,
had misjudged his turn, and cried out instinctively:</p>

<p>“We are over.”</p>

<p>But the limousine itself was struck heavily by the car
behind, and the detective and the princess were thrown
forward and bruised against the sides. Then the whole
horror of the situation was revealed. Sonia had fainted,
and the dark, surging waters of the lake were pouring into
the vehicle in icy torrents through the broken windows.
The limousine was sinking!</p>

<p>“Damnation!” roared Tom Bob; then, quick as lightning,
gripping the princess by one arm, he forced open
the door in spite of the weight of water and struck out.
<a id="png.154" href="#png.154"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>154<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>He was a powerful swimmer, and in a few seconds more he
and his precious burden had reached the bank of the lake.</p>

<p>There, the wildest confusion reigned. The first four
cars had plunged in one on top of the other; fortunately
those following, being a short distance behind, had been
able to brake and pull up in time. At the cries of the
drivers all with one accord had sprung to the ground, and
were now asking names, counting numbers, uttering
exclamations of surprise and fear. The panic was
indescribable.</p>

<p>It was indeed a most lucky chance there was no fatality
to deplore. Sonia’s car, the first in the line, was as a matter
of fact the only one that, by reason of its speed, had rolled
far enough into the lake to be half submerged. The drivers
of the vehicles behind, seeing the accident, had sheered
off to one side, had more or less jammed down their brakes
and, thanks to their reduced speed, had been able, not
indeed to avoid the disaster altogether, but at any rate to
diminish its ill consequences. The cars had come to a
stand on the very verge of the water.</p>

<p>Help was soon organized, and brave men sprang into
the lake to the rescue. Half an hour after the catastrophe,
it could be said for certain that it would have no very
serious sequel, apart of course, from any effects that might
ensue on the violent agitation all had experienced, and the
painful bruises some of these “shipwrecked mariners” had
received. Only the Princess Sonia Danidoff, imprisoned in
a vehicle that had actually sunk, was ever in positive danger
of death; and so, when the first bewilderment was over, it
was round the young Russian lady that the crowd gathered
thickest, questioning and congratulating.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tom Bob, his brow knit in anxious thought,
had drawn some of the men apart and was demonstrating
to them the causes of the accident.</p>

<p>“It is beyond belief!” he declared, “<span class="ellips">...</span> just look over
yonder<span class="ellips">!...</span> the thing was a criminal attempt! They
have masked the turn in the road by laying down the
bogus grass lawn over a length of ten yards, and extended
the road itself in a straight line right up to the waterside.
The footway is cut through! the wire fencing removed!
Why, they have even chalked over the rammed earth to
make it look as white as the road! For sure, no blame
<a id="png.155" href="#png.155"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>155<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>attaches to the chauffeur; in the glare thrown forward by
the lamps he was bound to make a mistake; he could not
possibly see the trap laid for him, and so, quite naturally,
he drove straight on till the final crash came.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob was going to say more when suddenly a cry
burst on the silence of the night, a cry of stupefaction,
of tearful distress. The detective flew to a group standing
round the Princess Danidoff, who still lay on the ground
inhaling a restorative.</p>

<p>“<span class="prellips">What </span><span class="ellips">...</span> what is it? what is happening now?”</p>

<p>The English Ambassador replied to the American detective’s
question.</p>

<p>“It is atrocious,” he cried, “the Princess Sonia Danidoff
has just discovered she has been robbed of articles of very
considerable value.”</p>

<p>For the moment the American stood stock still, as if
paralysed with amazement.</p>

<p>“What,” he exclaimed, “what is that you say?”</p>

<p>“I say, my good sir,” returned the Ambassador, “that
the Princess Sonia has been stripped of all her jewels, all
her jewels—do you hear what I say?—rings, bracelets, necklaces,
hair ornaments. Some hundreds of thousands of
francs gone!”</p>

<p>In his bewilderment Tom Bob could only repeat himself:
“But the thing’s past belief; it’s impossible! When did
it happen? and how?”</p>

<p>He darted to the princess’s side, while the Ambassador,
turning to a young <i lang="fr">attaché</i>, finished what he was saying
for his benefit.</p>

<p>“For my part,” he declared, “I consider the whole
catastrophe had but one object—this theft! It must have
been done while the princess lay in a faint and Tom Bob
had left her to help in saving life. Tom Bob, police-detective
as he is, never saw the wood for the trees!”</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">attaché</i> nodded: “You are doubtless right, sir; but
who can have organized this daring, this audacious plot?”</p>

<p>It was in a hushed voice, almost in a whisper, that the
Ambassador made answer:</p>

<p>“Who? Egad! I think there is only one man in all
the <span class="prellips">world </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and you know his name!”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.”</p>

<p><a id="png.156" href="#png.156"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>156<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Already on every lip the dread name was being repeated,
the name of horror and of blood, the name that alone could
make credible the incredible reality, that could make it
seem possible, that could account for it.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! he and no other must have
planned all this!”</p>

<p>And through the night, more grim than ever the three
tragic syllables re-echoed, spreading consternation—<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XV<br
 ><small>IN A PRIVATE ROOM</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc" lang="fr">M. Moche</span> was in a generous mood that morning. He now
beckoned to the waiter of the drinking shop where he sat
with a companion, the apache known by the nickname of
the “Gasman,” and ordered a bottle of wine and glasses
to be set on the table. But the old man had certainly not
summoned this “Gasman” to meet him merely for the
pleasure of standing the young ruffian a drink. For a good
quarter of an hour they had been hobnobbing together,
and the old business agent had been engaged in explaining
to his man the particular service he required of him. To
start with, indeed, and by way of preliminary to insure
the confidence and good will of his ally, <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, as he
shook hands on saying good-morning, had slipped between
the “Gasman’s” gnarled fingers a nice little bank note for
fifty francs, which the apache, nothing if not practical,
had instantly pocketed, prepared to learn later on what he
would have to do in return, or even to refuse to take on
the job if he did not fancy it.</p>

<p>When the bottle was half empty, <span lang="fr">Moche</span> came back to
the business in hand.</p>

<p>“Then it’s settled,” he asked, “we may count on you?”</p>

<p>The apache pushed his chair back, leant his great body
far across the table, rested his head between the palms of
his hands and looking hard at the old business man:</p>

<p>“That depends,” he announced in a decided tone.</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?” asked <span lang="fr">Moche</span> in surprise.</p>

<p>The “Gasman” repeated: “That depends. Question is
who’re we working for? For my part, since all these here
to-dos, you’ll understand, I’m beginning to be a bit off.
<span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> gang and me being in the know with ’em, that’s
all very fine and large; but sure as I’m here drinking at
your expense, the thing can’t go on, and it’s bound to
end badly.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that, my man; this business
<a id="png.158" href="#png.158"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>158<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>is my little game and nobody else’s. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> has nothing
to do with it. And what’s more, let me tell you, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
don’t like folks prying into his business, whoever they
may be; cute chap as you are, Mr. ‘Gasman,’ you’ll be
getting yourself into trouble, if you poke your nose in
there.”</p>

<p>“Right oh!” agreed the apache; “let’s talk about
<em>your</em> business then instead!”</p>

<p>“Well then,” resumed <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, “you quite understand
I count on you implicitly for to-night. Now there
must be two of you for the job, so stir your stumps this
afternoon and find a bully boy at a loose end. Who are you
going to take, eh?”</p>

<p>The apache thought a moment, twisting his long
moustache, then suggested:</p>

<p>“I don’t see anyone hardly but ‘Bull’s-eye,’ you know
who I mean, who’d just <span class="prellips">do </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> approved the selection: “That’s the ticket, go
and fix it up with your friend; he’s a good cuss and no
white liver,” he grinned.</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> grew grave again: “Don’t forget to bring
along all the properties—some good strong rope, and of
course a handkerchief, you know, to make a gag—part of
your stock in trade all that, eh, ‘Gasman’?”</p>

<p>Then, discovering it was half past eleven, and he was
behind time, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> shook the apache hurriedly by the
hand and vanished. With rapid strides the old usurer made
his way down the <span lang="fr">Rue de Belleville</span> and so to the line of
the exterior boulevards, where he hailed a cab, telling the
man to drive him to the <cite>Silver Goblet</cite>, a restaurant on the
<span lang="fr">Place de la Bastille</span>.</p>

<p>What new scheme could the dubious advocate of the
<span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span> be meditating now? What was the
shady enterprise he was planning, for which he needed
the co-operation of two notorious apaches from <span lang="fr">Ménilmontant</span>
like the “Gasman” and “Bull’s-eye”? On arriving
at his destination, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> took the landlord on one
side; the latter seemed an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>“I want you to keep me for to-night,” he whispered in
his ear, “the little pink room; I shall be coming to dine
there about eight o’clock with some swell clients; put on
a man who can hold his tongue to wait.”</p>

<p><a id="png.159" href="#png.159"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>159<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The restaurant keeper bowed respectfully.</p>

<p>“You can trust to me, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>, you shall have
what you want, and you shan’t be disturbed. Anyway,
the season’s drawing to a close and we’re hardly serving
any more dinners in private rooms; you may count on
having the whole floor practically to yourselves.”</p>

<p>The old fellow was entirely satisfied by what he heard,
and at once took his departure, striding fast along the
streets and whistling a cheerful march tune.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">“Dress-coat, smoking jacket? what is <span lang="fr">monsieur</span> going
to wear this evening?”</p>

<p>“Neither, John; lay out my lounge coat.”</p>

<p>“You are not going out then, sir, and you have not
anybody asked to dinner?”</p>

<p>Mr. Ascott stopped in the middle of arranging his tie;
and turning to his man, said sharply:</p>

<p>“I am not dining at home, and I ask you for my lounge
coat, that’s all.”</p>

<p>John, while obeying orders, still wore a scandalized air:</p>

<p>“Excuse my speaking like this, sir, but I cannot help
telling you, sir, that for some days now you have been
neglecting your personal appearance, sir. What, you are
going abroad, sir, in a lounge suit and dining out in such
a costume? In New York or in London, you would never
think of such a breach of etiquette.”</p>

<p>Ascott interrupted his man-servant’s flow of words with
a look of weary discouragement:</p>

<p>“I shall do just what I choose, John; and let me tell
you, it’s only out of consideration for your age and the
years you have been with my family I don’t reprimand
you severely for the liberties you take.”</p>

<p>The man dropped his eyes and with a chagrined air:</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, sir, it was only the interest I take in
you, sir, made me say what I did.”</p>

<p>Ascott let the matter drop. Presently, his hands very
busy adjusting a carnation in the buttonhole<!-- TN: hyphen removed for consistency --> of his coat,
he asked:</p>

<p>“The Princess Danidoff did not ring up on the ’phone
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; in fact it is several days now we have had
no news of the princess.”</p>

<p><a id="png.160" href="#png.160"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>160<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Well, John,” grunted Ascott, turning stiffly and facing
the man, “I am pleased to think it will go on so for a long
time; I’ve had enough of the Princess Sonia Danidoff, she’s
an ungrateful coquette. God knows how ready I was to
love her, how gladly I would have devoted my life to her
service, but she is crazy, crazy for another <span class="prellips">man, </span><span class="ellips">...</span> so
much the worse for me! But there, that’s her look
<span class="prellips">out </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>John looked his approval.</p>

<p>“Quite right, sir; these great ladies always give more
trouble than they’re worth, and if I might offer you a piece
of advice, <span class="prellips">sir </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“Well, out with it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it would be just to take for mistress one of those
pretty actresses there’s so many of in Paris and who would
ask nothing better, or else get to know a nice, good little
girl, a gentle and modest young thing who would love you
<span class="prellips">tenderly </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>Ascott burst into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“’Pon my word, John, you’re in a prophetic vein to-day,
ha, ha! Who tells you I’m not going to follow your
advice to the letter?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, do you know some young girl in society?”</p>

<p>“In society, h’m! not high society <span class="prellips">certainly </span><span class="ellips">...</span> but
one that is honest and peaceable and sincere; yes, perhaps
I do, and I’m beginning to think even I’m pretty deep in
love.”</p>

<p>John rubbed his hands in naïve satisfaction; he ventured:
“You must tell me about it, sir.”</p>

<p>But next minute Ascott checked himself and his face
resumed a stern look full of haughty reserve.</p>

<p>He was ready to go. “John, hand me my hat.”—“Very
good, Sir.”—“My stick.”—“Here it is, sir!”</p>

<p>“John, I shall not be back perhaps till late at night—perhaps
not at all; no need to sit up for me.”</p>

<p>“Very good, <span class="prellips">sir </span><span class="ellips">...</span> good-night, sir!”</p>

<p>“Good-night, John.”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">Seated at the back of the omnibus office in the <span lang="fr">Place
de la Bastille</span>, two persons were conversing in low voices;
they were <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, wearing, as always, his everlasting
top hat with the mangy nap and draped solemnly in his
<a id="png.161" href="#png.161"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>161<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>long frock-coat, and little <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, modestly clad in
a navy blue skirt barely reaching to the ankles and a straw
hat trimmed with wild flowers. To look at the pair you
would have taken them for people of the small shop-keeper
class—the father a worthy business <span lang="fr">employé</span>, the daughter
a school-girl, hardly out of the Convent. No one would
ever have dreamt he had before him the old usurer of the
<span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>, comrade and accomplice of the worst
apaches of the district, and least of all that the modest
maiden he saw there was a vulgar street-walker, a common
murderer’s mistress, seduced and ruined long ago, for all
her tender years.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> was grumbling sourly:</p>

<p>“The thing’s disgusting. Since they did away with the
<i lang="fr">correspondance</i> tickets, the omnibus offices are getting fewer
and fewer and less and less used. I had the devil’s own
job to find just this one here to arrange to meet you at.”</p>

<p>“But why,” demanded <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, teasing the old man, “why
couldn’t you let me join you at the pub on the corner there?
We could have swigged a half-pint or so then in the mug’s
honour.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> started, and putting on a grieved look, began
to scold the too outspoken <span lang="fr">Nini</span>—albeit he felt a strong
inclination to laugh all the while.</p>

<p>“You slut, will you never be serious? You spend your
time humbugging, trying to frighten me, you do. I’m all the
while in a stew you’ll let out a <em>big ’un</em> before <span class="prellips">him </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Nini</span> completed the old advocate’s sentence for him:</p>

<p>“<span class="ellips">...</span> A <em>big ’un</em> that’ll make him see I’m not just exactly
an angel come down from heaven with her crown of orange
blossom on her head, all ready to fall into his arms; eh,
<span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, isn’t that what makes you sweat?”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> knew better; he gave the child a friendly
tap on her rosy cheek: “No, not really, mind you; I’m
not a bit afraid, you’re a deal too artful to give yourself
away,” and looking admiringly at the girl, he added:</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t take much more to take <em>me</em> in, too, with
your modest, virtuous air, and those great innocent eyes
of yours!”</p>

<p>But next moment <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> turned serious.</p>

<p>“Attention!” he cried, “steady! here comes the pigeon;
stand by to blush, niece!”</p>

<p><a id="png.162" href="#png.162"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>162<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Never you fear, dear uncle,” replied <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, biting her
lips not to burst out laughing.</p>

<p>Thereupon Ascott appeared at the door of the omnibus
office; the young Englishman might have stepped out of
a bandbox, smart, elegant, freshly shaved, and carrying
in his arms an enormous bunch of flowers!</p>

<p>The complicated plot arranged some days beforehand
by old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> seemed to be working out under the most
favourable auspices. He had introduced his bogus niece
to the rich young Englishman at a highly opportune
moment, just when Ascott, chagrined at having paid
assiduous court to the Princess Sonia Danidoff, only to
see the latter prefer to himself the latest recruit to her
band of admirers, the American stranger, the detective,
Tom Bob, who, from the first moment of his arrival in
France, had worn in all men’s eyes an aureole of glory and
success. Moved less by love than by a sort of obstinacy,
Ascott had indeed striven to contend against this adversary,
but events had occurred so rapidly and so much in favour
of his rival that the wealthy Englishman, in spite of being
the first in the field and the first accredited suitor for the
princess’s hand, had been forced to take second place.
For was it not, in fact, this same Tom Bob again who,
forty-eight hours earlier, had rescued the unfortunate Sonia
Danidoff from a terrible and almost certain death? Evidently
the detective had not succeeded in saving the princess’s
jewels, but he had saved her life, and swore to
protect her against the mysterious and terrible attacks of
the ever elusive and enigmatic scoundrel, who seemed
especially bent on her destruction.</p>

<p>Wounded in his self-love and baulked in his passion, the
young Englishman had quickly come to his senses, and
this the more readily from the fact that, as his love for
Sonia Danidoff cooled more and more, he felt his heart
more and more stirred and charmed by a youthful passion
for the pretty child he supposed to be niece of the old
moneylender, the grotesque <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>. Moreover, startled
by the indignant refusal his first audacious proposal had
provoked, Ascott had immediately realized that this was
not the right way to deal with the old business man.
In fact, when he accompanied <span lang="fr">Nini</span> on her leaving the
house in the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>, he had also seen pretty
<a id="png.163" href="#png.163"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>163<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>clearly that the latter, good, obedient girl as she was,
must needs entertain the highest respect for her uncle.
So he had wisely told himself how desirable it was in the
first place to win the old man’s favour in order to secure
the child’s good graces.</p>

<p>The young Englishman accordingly invited <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>
to lunch, lunch for two, <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>. Moreover, despite the
instinctive repulsion he felt for the fellow, he found himself
forced to admit, before the meal was over, that he was
after all a cheerful boon-companion, not lacking in wit
and possessed of a store of racy anecdotes well calculated
to dispel his melancholy. Adroitly enough, Ascott brought
the conversation round to the subject of <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> little
niece, displaying an interest in the child’s future, and he
deemed himself more than clever when, after endless beating
about the bush, he finally succeeded in persuading
<span lang="fr">Père<!-- TN: original reads "Pêre" --> Moche</span> to dine with him and bring little <span lang="fr">Nini</span> with
him one evening soon.</p>

<p>Poor fellow, he little dreamt he had to do with a man far
cleverer than himself, and that the favour he had obtained
at the cost of so many difficulties was really and truly but
the consummation of the plot conceived by the Machiavellian
business agent and his abominable little accomplice.</p>

<p><span class="ellips">...</span> Thus Ascott arrived to the minute at the <i lang="fr">rendezvous</i>,
in the omnibus office in the Place de la Bastille at 7.30, his
heart in his mouth, his mind in a joyous tumult, his arms
full of flowers, all for the woman towards whom he now
began to feel a genuine and sincere affection!</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">The merry little dinner was drawing to an end. Old
<span lang="fr">Moche</span> had positively sparkled with wit throughout the
meal, but most of the time it was simply trouble wasted,
for Ascott hardly listened to a word. <span lang="fr">Moche</span> sat facing the
two young people, who, as if by inadvertence, had taken
their places on a narrow divan, so that as the festivity
proceeded they were perpetually coming into casual contact
with each other. At first the young man had discreetly
kept his distance, but little by little, growing
bolder under his senior’s indulgent eye—the old man
seemed to be getting tipsy—the lover drew nearer to his
charmer. From time to time he would squeeze her hand
under the table or throw an arm around her waist. The
<a id="png.164" href="#png.164"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>164<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>child looked demure and a trifle startled, affecting to be
embarrassed, sometimes even shocked, but at the same time
casting occasional sidewise glances at the rich Englishman
that were full of encouragement and spoke of passion only
held in check by maiden modesty.</p>

<p>Ascott, entering more and more into the spirit of the
thing, kept on replenishing his guests’ glasses with champagne,
hoping to intoxicate old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> altogether and make
the girl sufficiently tipsy to prove less obdurate in repelling
the caresses he lavished on her. He himself, too, by way
of stimulating his courage, was drinking pretty hard, and, all
things considered, was very likely consuming on his own
sole account a great deal more than his two companions
both together.</p>

<p>Once, as he was bending down behind <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, pretending
to pick something up from the floor, in reality in order to
put his burning lips to the cool, inviting surface of the
girl’s neck behind, Ascott failed to see how <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>,
with the lightning quickness of a conjuring trick, sprinkled
a whitey-grey powder over the frothing liquor in his champagne
glass. Dessert was on the table. But while <span lang="fr">Nini</span>,
nibbling at the strawberries on her plate, refused to drink
any more wine, Ascott, who was tormented with a thirst
that grew momentarily more intense, had a fourth bottle
of champagne uncorked, of which he poured a good third
into a glass for himself and drained it off at a draught.</p>

<p>The Englishman was rapidly getting drunk, and now threw
discretion to the winds in his plaguing of <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, who more
than once, playing her part to perfection, administered
some shrewd slaps on the young man’s over enterprising
hands. She even sprang up from her seat, as if to fly for
refuge to her uncle and demand his protection.</p>

<p>Old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> followed the whole scene with a very wide
awake glance, humming a tune at intervals and mimicking
the ways of a man excited by the fumes of a heady wine
and viewing life under the most roseate aspect. At a
given moment, however, the old fellow, after looking surreptitiously
at his watch, noted that it was half past eleven.
He rose from the table staggering. Ascott burst out laughing.
“By the Lord! my dear <span lang="fr">Moche</span>,” he cried out in a
thick voice, “I verily believe you’re jolly well drunk!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> swayed more unsteadily than ever on his feet.</p>

<p><a id="png.165" href="#png.165"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>165<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Drunk!” he replied, with a fine imitation of a drunkard’s
hoarse tones, “never such a thing! I’m merry, just merry—as
we all are. Here, just look here if I’m drunk; my
hand don’t shake.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> picked up a full glass, solemnly lifted it from the
table, rounding his elbow in a majestic gesture. Doubtless
his condition baulked his praiseworthy efforts, for the glass
after some frantic oscillations suddenly turned topsy turvy,
spilling the wine over the carpet.</p>

<p>The accident provoked an uproarious fit of wild mirth
from Ascott: “Oh! there is no doubt about it, the old
man is awfully drunk.” And now the young Englishman’s
cup of happiness was filled to the brim, as he heard the
other declare:</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I don’t feel very well, my head’s going round
a bit. With your leave, I’ll go out and breathe the fresh
air a minute; but none of your nonsense now whilst I’m
away! Ascott, I count on your good behaviour, I entrust
that dear, good, virtuous child to your care”—and <span lang="fr">Père
Moche</span> disappeared.</p>

<p>Scarcely was he out of the room before Ascott shook off
his intoxication and managed to rise from the divan on
which he sprawled. Stepping to the door of the private
room, he shot the bolt with an unsteady hand; then, regardless
of <span lang="fr">Nini’s</span> hypocritical prayers and protests, he went
to the switch and turned off the electric current.</p>

<p>“Oh! sir, sir!” shrilled the girl in a terrified voice, “what
are you doing<span class="ellips">?...</span> oh<span class="ellips">!...</span> for God’s sake, let me
<span class="prellips">be </span><span class="ellips">...</span> mother!”</p>

<p>Meantime, no sooner was <span lang="fr">Moche</span> out in the passage leading
to the private rooms than he recovered all his coolness
and self-possession, as if by a miracle. The old scamp was
much too astute to have let himself get tipsy; it was simply
a piece of play-acting he had been at for the benefit of his
host, a comedy that did not in the least take in his confidante
and accomplice, <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, though it completely
bamboozled the young Englishman. With no small satisfaction
<span lang="fr">Moche</span> noted—as indeed the landlord had led him
to expect when he came that morning to order the little
dinner—that the adjoining rooms were unoccupied. After
that he made sure that no one could spy on them from the
floor below.</p>

<p><a id="png.166" href="#png.166"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>166<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Everything was as it should be. The host of the <cite>Silver
Goblet</cite> was used to these little private entertainments and
knew it was not the proper thing to disturb those attending
them under any circumstances. No doubt, somewhere
about one o’clock in the morning, a waiter would come up
to announce that it was time to be leaving, as the house was
going to be shut up, but till that hour guests could count
implicitly on the most absolute peace and quietness.</p>

<p>Next, slipping down the back stairs leading direct from
the <i lang="fr">entresol</i> into the street, <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was quickly in the open
air. Advancing a few paces along the sidewalk, he whistled
and then stood listening. A second later a succession of
notes became audible, similar to those formed by the old
man’s lips; again advancing, he came upon two fellows
lurking in a doorway. It was the “Gasman” and “Bull’s-eye,”
and not far off stood an automobile, to which the old
man pointed with the question: “It’s yours, that contraption
yonder?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the “Gasman,” “that’s to say it’s a pal’s
machine; we chose him because he’s as silent as the tomb,
and don’t have no eyes in the back of his head; he’ll do
what he’s told—asks three louis for his night.”</p>

<p>“All serene!” declared <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, rubbing his hands. “Now
listen to me, you chaps; keep an eye on the shanty I’ve come
out of, and when I show my hat out of the window, you
must come along softly, the pigeon’ll be asleep. The pigeon’s
mate’ll go with you and no fuss, you may rely on that. As
you drive on, best clap on the cords and the gag; you might
be interrupted, and it must all be shipshape, just to avoid
accidents. Twig?”</p>

<p>“Right oh!” sang out “Bull’s-eye” and the “Gasman”
in chorus.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span>, in generous mood, handed over to each of them
a fifty franc note: “You see,” he pointed out, “I always
pay well.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” growled “Bull’s-eye,” “that ain’t like <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
that ain’t! Didn’t I give him a hand in that there lake
business, when he cleared off with the princess’s jewelry.
Well, if I’ve made a brown or two out of it, that’s about
all—just because he didn’t see me at work. I’m thinking if
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> don’t fork <span class="prellips">out </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“All serene,” <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> interrupted his grumblings
<a id="png.167" href="#png.167"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>167<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“there’s no question of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> for the moment. Be
smart, be <span class="prellips">ready </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I’m going up there again.”</p>

<p>At the door of the private room, the old man, resuming
his former rôle, gave a discreet tap, saying with a laugh:</p>

<p>“Why, what now<span class="ellips">?...</span> so you’ve locked yourself in, eh?
a little joke, for sure<span class="ellips">?...</span> but no more nonsense now!
Come, come, open the door. Do be serious a <span class="prellips">bit </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and
then you know, I’m still thirsty, I want to finish out the
bottle!”</p>

<p>Then he stopped talking to listen. Not a sound came
from inside and the old fellow was growing impatient. He
knocked twice, sharply and peremptorily.</p>

<p>At last the door opened, and <span lang="fr">Nini</span> appeared, her hair
flying loose and her clothes in disorder.</p>

<p>“What a time he’s been giving me!” she whispered
grinning, “a devil of a fellow, my dear man!”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was in no joking mood; he demanded: “And
now?”</p>

<p>“Now,” <span lang="fr">Nini</span> proceeded, still speaking under her breath;
but opening the door a little wider, so that <span lang="fr">Moche</span> could
slip into the room, which was still in darkness, “now he’s
snoring like a good ’un! suppose it’s the powder you tipped
into his champagne; I bet he’s good to sleep on till to-morrow
morning, come what may.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> looked down at Ascott, who lay stretched on the
divan, and saw that <span lang="fr">Nini</span> was speaking the truth; the
young man was sleeping like a top. The old usurer shook
him by the arm, twitched his hair, but the Englishman, as
drunk as a lord and bowled over into the bargain by the
soporific he had swallowed, was beyond rousing.</p>

<p>Without relighting the lights, <span lang="fr">Moche</span> ran to the window
and waved his hat out of it; then coming back into the
room, he laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>“First-rate, my gal, it’s going first-rate,” he assured
<span lang="fr">Nini</span>; “to my mind the job’s as good as done!”</p>

<p>The two accomplices fell silent a moment, then with one
impulse both stood listening. On the stairs communicating
directly with the street the sound of stealthy footsteps
could be heard. It was “Bull’s-eye” and the “Gasman”
coming up.</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XVI<br
 ><small>NEXT MORNING!</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Heavy-eyed</span>, with a smarting brow and a raging headache,
Ascott awoke late the following morning. It was about
ten o’clock when the young man in the big four-poster,
whose twisted Renaissance pillars almost touched the ceiling,
stretched his cramped limbs and slowly came back to a
consciousness of his surroundings. His throat was parched
with an insatiable thirst; mechanically and without opening
his eyes, for he knew to a nicety the position of the various
articles that stood near his bed, he extended a faltering
arm towards a little table at the bedside, reaching for the
water bottle his carefully trained servant used to put there
every night full of water. His hand felt over the marble
top of the table, but failed to find what he sought. He was
so weary, his head was throbbing so painfully he could not
at first summon up courage enough to rise. Again lazily
stretching, he turned over between the sheets and tried to
get to sleep again, setting his face to the wall to guard his
smarting eyes against the light of day that penetrated the
heavy curtains drawn across the window.</p>

<p>Not a sound was audible; the mansion the wealthy Englishman
had purchased some weeks ago was as silent as
the grave, the domestics far away in the basement where
the offices and kitchen were situated going about their
business softly so as not to disturb their master’s slumbers.
Nor did the latter feel the smallest desire to get up, though
out of doors the weather was magnificent, the sky of Paris
as blue as on an Italian summer’s day and the temperature,
genial even at this morning hour, promising an afternoon
of almost tropical heat.</p>

<p>But sleep refused to come at the young man’s call; his
throat was burning, his mouth dry as a bone. Drink he
must at all costs to quench the fire that consumed him,
to mitigate these painful and inevitable consequences of
<a id="png.169" href="#png.169"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>169<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his over indulgence in the generous wines of the night
before. Screwing up his courage to the needful effort,
slowly, painfully, moving like an automaton, Ascott sat
up in bed, clasped his damp brow, then slipped one leg
from between the sheets; the other followed, his naked feet
shivering as they touched the bedside mat. Catching a
glimpse of a dressing gown lying within reach on a chair,
he put it on with the cross and sulky looks of an ill-used
martyr.</p>

<p>“That beast of a John,” he was thinking, “by forgetting
to put my water ready last night will have made me ill for
the rest of the day!”</p>

<p>Stumbling across the room, his eyes still only half open,
Ascott made for the dressing room adjoining his bedroom,
in which he felt sure—at least he hoped so—of finding a
supply of clear, fresh water that should revive his energies
depressed by the consumption of unlimited alcoholic liquors
and liqueurs. He opened the door of his bathroom, but
on the point of entering, he stopped dead on the threshold,
dumbfounded by what he saw, albeit with a very vague
and confused comprehension of the apparition that met his
gaze! The room, generally so neat and tidy and meticulously
ordered, every crystal phial and pomatum pot and
toilet article in its appointed place on the dressing table,
was this morning in the wildest disorder. There were
bottles without stoppers giving out heady perfumes, brushes
scattered about the floor, towels tossed at random over the
backs of chairs.</p>

<p>But what above all else surprised the young man and
filled him with the most intense amazement was to see on the
<span lang="fr">Louis Seize</span> settee, where he often threw himself after his
bath to be massaged by his servant man to restore his
numbed limbs to their proper suppleness, a woman lying
there, half undressed and her hair undone, curled up on
the couch buried in heavy, but restless slumbers. Her
clothes, her skirt, her bodice lay about the floor, her shoes
lay one in a corner cheek by jowl with a copper kettle,
the other precariously perched on the shelf of a what-not!</p>

<p>Ascott had no need to look twice to recognize the sleeper.
It was <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, old <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span> niece, the girl he had dined
with yesterday evening in the private <span class="prellips">room </span><span class="ellips">...</span> who at
the close of the entertainment when her uncle went away,
<a id="png.170" href="#png.170"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>170<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had been left alone with <span class="prellips">him, </span><span class="ellips">...</span> whom he had made his
mistress!</p>

<p>Ascott gazed long at the sleeping figure in utter bewilderment;
he was still very tired and his mind was slow to
understand, while an atrocious neuralgic headache tortured
him. What had happened then, following the moment when
he had found himself alone with <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span> in the private
room at the restaurant in the <span lang="fr">Place de la Bastille</span>? He
could remember nothing, he had forgotten everything. All
the same his conscience told him that the history of subsequent
events should not be very difficult to reconstruct.
At the same time he was suffering atrociously, his head, his
forehead, the nape of his neck were all seats of horrid pain.
It felt as though every hair that bristled on his skull was a
needle point painfully pricking the scalp. Putting off till
later all thought of seriously considering his plight, Ascott,
on tip-toe, moving carefully to avoid making the slightest
noise, but as a first preliminary having drained at a draught
half the contents of a water-jug, crept across the room,
resolved to regain his bed and sleep off the last vestiges of
his fatigue.</p>

<p>But hardly had he taken a couple of steps when he started
and swore. A soft knock had sounded on the door. The
tired man deemed no reply needful; no one surely would
venture to come in without his permission, and that he was
not disposed to give. But evidently it was ordained that
the unfortunate young man should not be left in peace that
morning to sleep off the effects of his last night’s indulgence.
In defiance of the established customs of the house, hitherto
invariably respected, the door, without leave given, was
half opened. A head appeared, a face of consternation, the
head and face of his servant John. Ascott, who at the
moment was making for the bed, turned sharply round and
sitting down on the coverlet, addressed the domestic in
angry tones:</p>

<p>“What ever has come to you, John what do you want?
I haven’t rung, that I know of.”</p>

<p>For all that the man pushed into the room and advanced
some steps nearer his master.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, sir,” he murmured, “I should never have
dared to come into your bedroom, sir, without being summoned,
but there’s someone wishing <span class="prellips">to </span><span class="ellips">...</span>”<!-- TN: original has period plus ellipsis --></p>

<p><a id="png.171" href="#png.171"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>171<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Ascott stifled<!-- TN: original reads "stfled" --> a yawn, signifying by a peremptory wave
of the hand his refusal to hear another word.</p>

<p>“You are mad, John; you know perfectly well I never
receive visitors at this hour of the day.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir, but it seems it is important.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is important enough to wake me up for,” declared
Ascott.</p>

<p>But the servant went on with extraordinary and unprecedented
persistency.</p>

<p>“It is the old fellow who sometimes comes to see you, sir,
the business agent, your lawyer, sir, old <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>. I
explained you could not see him, sir, but he insisted all the
same, he almost forced me to come up <span class="prellips">here </span><span class="ellips">...</span> please
excuse me, sir, <span class="prellips">but </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>His master was furious. Calling up, not without difficulty,
all the will power he possessed, all the energy he
was capable of that morning, he vociferated passionately:</p>

<p>“I will <em>not</em> see him and if the old chap insists, chuck
him out of the house!”</p>

<p>Ascott had hardly uttered the words before a grave and
dignified voice was heard in the anteroom adjoining the
bed-chamber, and at the same moment there issued from the
shadows, pushing his way into the room, someone whose
identity could admit of no mistake even to the Englishman’s
sleepy eyes. It was in fact <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> coming in,
in defiance of all prohibition. Dressed, as always, in his
long, black frock-coat, holding in his hand his tall hat with
the dulled, dented surface, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> showed dirtier and still
more repulsive-looking in the broad light of day than by
candlelight, but also more solemn and more majestic.</p>

<p>The old man bowed slightly to Ascott, who sat silent and
impassive on his bed.</p>

<p>“I have to speak to you, sir, to speak to you, alone,” he
announced, casting a thunderous glance at the old servant,
but the latter never budged, waiting for his master’s orders.</p>

<p>Ascott resigned himself to the inevitable: “Go, John,”
he ordered, “we wish to be alone.”</p>

<p>Hardly had the door closed behind the servant before
<span lang="fr">Moche</span>, throwing his calm and majestic manner to the winds,
rushed up to the young Englishman and in a beseeching
voice half choked with emotion, but nevertheless showing
just a shade of menace, demanded:</p>

<p><a id="png.172" href="#png.172"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>172<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Sir, where is my niece, my child? what have you done
with my sister’s child?”</p>

<p>Ascott shook in his shoes; just what he was fearing had
occurred, and that at a time, at an hour in the morning,
when he would have given all he possessed to be left in
peace. He made a slight, nonchalant, evasive gesture,
feigning he had never an inkling of the meaning of <span lang="fr">Père
Moche’s</span> question.</p>

<p>“Your niece,” he protested, “I know nothing of what
has become of her; am I her keeper?”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> broke in again. With rising passion the old
business man shouted:</p>

<p>“You lie, sir; you have odiously abused my trust in you,
abused the friendship I felt for you. Do not try to deny
your guilt; I know all. To begin with, taking advantage
of a moment’s negligence on my part, you locked yourself
in alone with <span lang="fr">Nini</span> in the private room where we all three
dined, and like a very satyr, a perfect monster of vice, you
were dastard enough to seduce my niece, poor child!”</p>

<p>Playing his odious comedy to perfection, the old fellow
sank into a chair, and dropping his head between his hands,
pretended to sob. In a piteous voice, he whined:</p>

<p>“Poor child! poor darling <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, so gentle, so pure, so
virtuous, what a hideous awakening must this have been
for her. Oh! I can picture her despair and horror. It is
frightful, maddening!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> sprang up and again approached Ascott, who,
vexed beyond measure, was gazing on the scene with a dazed
expression in his haggard eyes.</p>

<p>“What has become of her? We have spent a dreadful
night, sir, I tortured with fear and anxiety, her poor mother
in terrible suspense, for <span lang="fr">Nini</span> has never returned home;
where is she? you alone can say, and you must and shall.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as he spoke, <span lang="fr">Moche</span> had gone over to the
window and half-drawn back the curtains, admitting daylight
into the darkened room. Seeing that the bed was
empty, that the bedroom showed no signs of disorder and
held no one else save the young Englishman, the old
brigand appeared surprised, not to say disconcerted. For
some moments he stood hesitating, at fault, thinking to
himself:</p>

<p>“So ho! then the business can’t have turned out quite as
<a id="png.173" href="#png.173"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>173<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I expected! that imbecile of a little <span lang="fr">Nini</span> must have misunderstood,
can she have been such a fool as to go before I
got here?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> stood biting his lips in perplexity, hesitating what
course to follow, and to gain time began shouting at Ascott
again:</p>

<p>“What has become of <span lang="fr">Nini</span>? what have you done with
her? answer me, sir, answer me!”</p>

<p>But the young man was trembling with apprehension.
He had been listening and in spite of the rumpus old <span lang="fr">Moche</span>
was kicking up, he caught the sound of faint, furtive noises
coming from the adjoining room. For a little while the
Englishman had been congratulating himself on his success
in feigning ignorance and seeming to attach no meaning to
the questions addressed to him by the unspeakable uncle
of the pretty child he had made his mistress the evening
before. He hoped that, wearying of the contest, old <span lang="fr">Moche</span>
would go away, and firm in his original intention, he swore
to himself he would then double lock his door and at any
cost go on sleeping for at least another two hours!</p>

<p>But now the noise in the dressing room was upsetting his
plans, for he felt convinced that <span lang="fr">Nini</span> was certainly awake.
What would the girl decide to do? Infuriated by the attitude
adopted by the man who, taking her by surprise and
defenceless, had become her lover, would she spring forth
and demand vengeance, or else, dumb with despair, covered
with shame at her dishonour, would she be afraid to show
herself in the disorder of her morning toilet before the eyes
of the old uncle she loved and seemed to esteem so highly?</p>

<p>Ascott had no time left him to weigh probabilities at
length, for the first of these two hypotheses was promptly
realized. Besides which, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> had also, like Ascott,
heard noises in the adjoining room, and instinctively the
old fellow was making for the door of the dressing room
when <span lang="fr">Nini</span> appeared.</p>

<p>The girl was pale as death, her eyes glittered with a
strange brilliance, her lips quivered in a nervous spasm;
at sight of her uncle and as if surprised to find him there,
she made a show of hesitation, first advancing, then drawing
back. Finally, she darted to the old man’s side, threw herself
into his arms and hiding her face on his shoulder, broke
into loud sobs, crying:</p>

<p><a id="png.174" href="#png.174"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>174<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Oh, uncle, uncle! dear uncle!”</p>

<p>The scene the two base accomplices were playing with
such noteworthy spirit to cajole the rich Englishman was
assuredly touching, and it was interpreted with a consummate
art worthy of professional actors. But the play was
only beginning! <span lang="fr">Nini</span> now tore herself from the arms of
her supposed relative and turning to Ascott, gazed long at
her lover with a look at once tender and aggrieved. Then,
very softly, she murmured:</p>

<p>“Oh, sir! sir! what have you done?”</p>

<p>Next old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> took the cue: “You have dishonoured
her, sir; you have committed an irreparable crime; it is
shameful, abominable!”</p>

<p>While her uncle was speaking, <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, overwhelmed by
the intensity of her emotion, fell to the floor and lay sobbing
in the cleverly calculated pose of a beautiful statue of
Grief!</p>

<p>Ascott was dreadfully upset by the unpleasant incident.
The young man cursed the mad fit that had come over
him the night before, while he experienced a very genuine
regret at the thought that he had ruined this pretty child,
who through his fault had lost her good name for ever.</p>

<p>Meantime a fresh witness of the lamentable scene suddenly
arrived. John burst into the room like a whirlwind.
Running to his master:</p>

<p>“Sir, sir,” he cried, “the world is coming to an end!”</p>

<p>The Englishman, whose raging headache, so far from
getting better, was growing more agonizing every minute,
nevertheless preserved an imperturbable calm.</p>

<p>“What ever is to do, John, what d’you want?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” continued the domestic, who with blanched face
and eyes unnaturally dilated, was staring at his master and
<span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, and above all at the young woman lying on
the floor, “Sir, it is the law!”</p>

<p>“The law!” cried Ascott; “you are mad, John!”</p>

<p>“No, sir, no, I am not mad; it is a Judge, a Court of
Law, I don’t know what all!”</p>

<p>His master was soon to be enlightened. Just as a little
before <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> had pushed into the bedroom without
being announced, with a like lack of ceremony three individuals
had made their way along the corridor to the door
of the room, and now stepped across the threshold. One of
<a id="png.175" href="#png.175"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>175<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>them advanced in front of the other two, a man of forty
or so, short, with a jovial-looking face and a heavy, black
moustache; he pulled from his pocket a tricolour scarf,
which he displayed before Ascott’s astonished eyes.</p>

<p>“I am the Commissary of Police, sir,” he announced. “Is
it to <span lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Ascott I have the honour to speak?”</p>

<p>“To the same,” replied the young man, turning pale,
while drops of cold sweat gathered on his brow.</p>

<p>“You sent for me, sir,” pursued the Commissary.</p>

<p>“I!” exclaimed Ascott, “never such a thing! it wasn’t I!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> broke into the dialogue: “It was I, <span lang="fr">Monsieur
le Commissaire</span>, who took the liberty of asking you to
come, and also, you will remember, the two gentlemen who
are with you.”</p>

<p>“I’m utterly at sea,” muttered Ascott, in a wearied voice;
“I don’t <span class="prellips">understand </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“You will soon understand!” declared <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, truculently.</p>

<p>After that Ascott began to scrutinize in sick bewilderment
not only the Police Commissary, but also the two men who
stood behind him, a pair of white-faced loafers of dubious
aspect and repulsive countenance; they stood twisting about
in evident embarrassment, jumping from one foot to the
other and mechanically turning about their greasy caps
between their fingers.</p>

<p>Presently the Commissary addressed the two apaches,
pointing to M. Ascott.</p>

<p>“Do you recognize that gentleman?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, it’s as you might say, the party what engaged
us last evening, about midnight, at the restaurant of the
<span class="prellips"><cite>Silver Goblet</cite> </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>The Commissary questioned Ascott: “You were dining,
were you not, at a restaurant in the <span lang="fr">Place de la Bastille</span>,
with the gentleman here present and <span lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>?”—and
the magistrate, to avoid any possibility of
mistake, pointed in succession to <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> and <span lang="fr">Nini
Guinon</span>.</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Ascott, not understanding what his
questioner would be at.</p>

<p>“Good,” continued the Commissary, and put another
question:</p>

<p>“Are you ready to let us hear the proposals you made
<a id="png.176" href="#png.176"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>176<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to these two gentlemen?”—this time pointing to “Bull’s-eye”<!-- TN: apostrophe inserted for consistency -->
and the “Gasman.”</p>

<p>But the Englishman could only stare in bewilderment
at the two ruffians; he cudgelled his brains in vain, and
despite the strain he imposed on his addled wits, he could
<em>not</em> remember having made any proposal whatsoever to the
individuals before him.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know those persons,” he articulated with
difficulty.</p>

<p>The Commissary gave a sceptical smile.</p>

<p>“Speak!” he ordered, addressing the “Gasman,” “Repeat
to the gentleman the deposition you came to my office
to make.”</p>

<p>“Here’s for it then!” the apache spoke with some show
of embarrassment at telling his story before everybody, “it
was like this—the two of us, ‘Bull’s-eye’ and I, we were just
on the saunter last evening, as you might say, near by the
<span lang="fr">Bastille</span>, when all of a minute we saw a toff a-coming down
the stairs of the swell pub; it was the gentleman you say,
the Englishman here present. He seemed a bit squiffy as
he talked; he said to us like this: ‘There’s a brace of quid
to be made, my lads, if you’ll lend a hand to help a lady
down who’s ill seemingly upstairs, and take her back to her
home; only, case she should kick up a bit of a rumpus,
mustn’t let her talk.’ We chaps, we ain’t no millionaires,
you know, sir, and two quid’s not to be refused. ‘Right oh!’
we told the Englishman, and there we were a-going up the
stairs of the house. The Englishman, he took us into a private
ken, where there was a wench, who set up a devil of a
screeching when she saw us; but the Englishman claps a
napkin over her mug, seemingly to make a gag; then says
he to us: ‘Off you go, hook it, stir your stumps! There’s
another two quid if you do it sharp!’ That made four
quid, so you may bet your life we were on, sir. Then we get
the baggage downstairs, clap her in a motor-car, and the
four of us drive off here, all serene like. The wench never
moved; by the Englishman’s orders she’d been tied up hand
and foot; he paid fair and square and went straight in.</p>

<p>“But look’ee, sir, getting back to the <span lang="fr">Bastille</span>, we two,
‘Bull’s-eye’ and self, we began to feel middling dicky,
telling ourselves maybe we’d been lending a hand at a dirty
job. Then just as we came out on the <span lang="fr">Place</span> from the
<a id="png.177" href="#png.177"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>177<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>last Underground and were harking back to the <cite>Silver Goblet</cite>
for to see what had been doing since, blessed if we didn’t
come upon the stout gentleman who’s sitting in the armchair
there, and who we’ve found out since is called
<span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>—the old bird was singing out a good ’un,
tearing his hair, he was! His niece, he kept bawling, had
disappeared, had been carried off by a satyr! he was in
despair, he said, he didn’t know where she was. Then
‘Bull’s-eye’ made up to him:</p>

<p>“‘Wasn’t she a little, dark girl, the wench you’re howling
about?’ he asks him.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, <span class="prellips">yes </span><span class="ellips">...</span> Might you, maybe, know where she is?’</p>

<p>“‘Maybe we might, and maybe we might not.’</p>

<p>“‘Bull’s-eye,’ he was getting to feel funny-like, and I
wasn’t just over happy, we’d been and done a nasty trick.
But there was a way, p’raps, to make up for our foolishness,
and we made up our minds to do the right thing. Old
<span lang="fr">Moche</span>, he stuck to us all night; back we trotted to the
district we’d taken the wench to, hunted round to recognize
the house and found it at last.</p>

<p>“<!-- TN: superfluous single quote removed -->And then <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, he out with it:</p>

<p>“‘Must come along with me to the Commissary, my lads,
and tell him the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth; else you may be certain sure you’re in for a hatful
of trouble!’<!-- TN: closing quote invisible --> So there you are, sir, that’s what we did!”</p>

<p>The apache broke off, then suddenly, with a superb
gesture, drawing four gold louis from his pocket, he spread
them out in the hollow of his hand, and marching up to
Ascott, he made a proposal to the rich Englishman that
astounded the latter more than ever.</p>

<p>“Would it hurt you, sir, to take back your money? The
tin was not honestly earned, and it burns our fingers!”</p>

<p>With a look of disgust the apache tossed on to the young
man’s knees the four gold coins, which rolled under the
bed.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> broke in: “Such, <span lang="fr">Monsieur le Commissaire</span>,
are the facts as they occurred—you know them yourself,
sir; indeed, M. Ascott does not deny them. Besides which,
the presence in his house of my unhappy niece, a mere
child, sir, barely sixteen years of age, whom he has odiously
wronged, is surely the best proof of <span class="prellips">guilt </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> never finished his sentence. At last Ascott
<a id="png.178" href="#png.178"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>178<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was master of the situation; a grim passion of indignation
was rising in his breast, the blazing anger only men of a cold,
calm temperament are capable of. With never a thought
of the dignity of the functionary he addressed, he pointed
to the door, and: “Out of the room, sir!” he ordered the
Commissary. With majestic mien, the magistrate turned
on his heel, still holding, however, his tricolour scarf in
his hand.</p>

<p>“Moderate your language, sir!” he protested, in haughty
accents; “do not forget you are speaking to the representative
of law and order. However, I obey your wish, deeming
my duty to be completed in this house.” Then, turning to
the two apaches:</p>

<p>“I will likewise ask the witnesses to withdraw, in an
orderly way and in silence.”</p>

<p>Finally he addressed himself to <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span>:</p>

<p>“If the young lady, your niece, sir, wishes to go, she
will find a conveyance at the door.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> overwhelmed the Commissary with his thanks,
while <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, who had a little before retired into the dressing
room, was hastily completing her toilet to quit the house
of the man who had become her lover in so strange a
fashion. Some minutes passed in silence, during which the
several actors in this amazing scene were busy with the most
varied reflections. <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> remained impassive to all
outward seeming, but in his heart he was overjoyed at the
happy turn events were taking; once or twice he threw a
meaning glance at his two confederates of the previous
evening, who had carried out his instructions so well.</p>

<p>In telling his story, invented for the occasion, the “Gasman”
had actually spoken in the very tones of one convinced
of the truth of what he was relating. The fellow had made
no mistakes, he had narrated the adventure exactly in the
way agreed upon, and above all, <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> admired the
apache’s final act, one that had not been arranged beforehand,
the act of giving back to Ascott the accursed gold
wherewith he had, as he thought, bought the complicity of
the two wretches, an act calculated to remove all doubt
from the Commissary’s mind, if by any chance he should
have been dubious of the witnesses’ good faith.</p>

<p>“By Gad! though,” <span lang="fr">Moche</span> muttered to himself by way
of conclusion. “Ascott makes eighty francs by the
<a id="png.179" href="#png.179"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>179<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>transaction—eighty francs I shall have to make good to the two
scamps!”</p>

<p>As for Ascott, he was asking himself in ever-increasing
bewilderment, if he were not the victim of a delusion, a
nightmare, a hideous dream. Yes, he had a perfect recollection
of the evening’s dinner that began so gaily, and he
was bound to confess that at the end of the meal, taking
advantage of old <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span> absence, he had indeed wronged
little <span lang="fr">Nini</span>—though all the same, he could not help thinking
the girl had not offered any very determined resistance. But
of what might have happened afterwards, he could recall
nothing whatever. He seemed to remember falling fast
asleep, and he could not for an instant believe he had gone
out to look for a pair of apaches to have <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>
forcibly carried off to his house<span class="ellips">....</span> Yet, it <em>might</em> be so,
for on the one hand they said it was, while on the other,
on awakening he had actually found <span lang="fr">Nini</span> fast asleep on the
couch in his dressing room.</p>

<p>But presently the young Englishman began to ask himself
what, after all, was the vast importance of all these incidents,
and why such a mighty disturbance was being made
over the adventure. He had not to wait long for the
explanation!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <span lang="fr">Nini</span> was ready to go; the girl looked prettier
than ever with her modest mien and assumed look of
shamefacedness, as she made slowly for the door, by which
“Bull’s-eye”<!-- TN: apostrophe inserted for consistency --> and the “Gasman” had already taken their
departure some while ago. After casting a long look of
affection and reproach at her rich lover, she preceded her
uncle and the magistrate as they left the room.</p>

<p>But before actually crossing the threshold, the magistrate
called a halt, to point out to Ascott the consequences implied
by his visit.</p>

<p>“All this, sir, makes it my duty,” he announced sternly,
“to draw up an official report; you must be aware that the
position in which you have placed yourself is a very
serious one; it is a matter for the Criminal Assize, involving
as it does, abduction of a minor, further aggravated by
violation and rape. I ought, properly speaking, to arrest
you. Be very grateful I do not do so, and hold yourself
at the disposition of the Court.”</p>

<p>“What is that you say, sir?” cried Ascott, in sudden
<a id="png.180" href="#png.180"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>180<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>alarm. But the magistrate merely bowed to the Englishman
without another word and made his exit.</p>

<p>For a moment the young man was left alone in the room,
but presently, plucking up his spirits, he sprang hurriedly to
the door of the ante-room:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Moche, Monsieur Moche</span>!” he called the old man back
in a voice choked with agitation. <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was already half-way
down the stairs, but he turned back and re-entered
the room:</p>

<p>“What do you want with me, sir?” he asked, eyeing the
Englishman haughtily up and down.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Moche</span>, come here,” said the latter, and hurriedly catching
the other by the sleeve of his coat, he led him into an
adjoining room, his library and study. In feverish haste
he pulled open a drawer and took out a cheque-book.
Dipping a pen in the ink, he paused before writing to ask:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur Moche</span>, how much?”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon!” said the old brigand.</p>

<p>Ascott, mastering his nerves, repeated once more:</p>

<p>“I ask you, how much do you want? this is a cheque I
have here, which I am ready to sign in your favour; fix
the amount yourself, and let us have done with this
nonsense.”</p>

<p>A gleam of cupidity flashed in the usurer’s eyes, but
that astute personage did not yield to the temptation.
It was not in that fashion he hoped to bleed the Englishman;
his project was more pretentious, his plan more complicated
than that. The old man feigned the greatest
indignation:</p>

<p>“It is shameful, sir; you insult me! After your villainous
treatment of my niece, you offer me money. Sir, you mistake
my character altogether! No, sir, I do not take that
bait, the affair must follow its course!”</p>

<p>Ascott turned livid. “<span lang="fr">Moche</span>,” he supplicated, “we are
<span class="prellips">friends </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“We <em>were</em> friends, sir.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Moche<span class="ellips">!...</span> Monsieur Moche</span>! I cannot have a scandal!”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, my niece, sir, is dishonoured.”</p>

<p>“But, <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, how can this be arranged?”</p>

<p>“There is but one way, sir, to right the wrong done,
religion and society offer you the means.”</p>

<p><a id="png.181" href="#png.181"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>181<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Ascott hesitated a moment, then he replied with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Marriage, you mean?” he cried; “you would have me
marry <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Nini Guinon </span><span class="ellips">...</span> you forget that I am a great
nobleman!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> corrected: “Lord Ascott, yes; but that’s not you,
that is your father.”</p>

<p>“I am his <span class="prellips">son </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“His younger son, sir, which is by no means the same
thing. There is nothing should hinder your marrying an
honest girl whom you have led astray from the paths of
duty.”</p>

<p>Ascott was obviously wavering. “<span lang="fr">Moche</span>, my good
friend, <span lang="fr">Moche</span>!” he besought the old scamp, “there must be
other ways of settling the question; I am rich, I care nothing
for the <span class="prellips">money </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“Enough!” <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> cut him short peremptorily, “I
have told you, sir, what a true-hearted gentleman, what a
man of honour, would not for one instant hesitate to do.
On the basis of repairing the wrong by marriage, you will
find us always ready to listen to you, to facilitate matters;
otherwise, it is of no use attempting to see me again”—and
the old man marched majestically for the door, leaving
Ascott absolutely dumbfounded, the pen trembling between
his fingers, his cheque-book lying open before his eyes.</p>

<p>However, before finally going, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> came to a halt
on the threshold, and in a ringing voice, threw down a final
challenge, a supreme work of menace and defiance:</p>

<p>“We shall meet again, <span class="prellips">sir </span><span class="ellips">...</span> in the Court of Assize.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">In</span> the drives of the <span lang="fr">Parc des Princes</span>, as a rule deserted
in the evening, the sombre ways that start from the fortifications
and unite Paris with <span lang="fr">Boulogne-sur-Seine</span>, ways
bordered by sumptuous private mansions, elegant villas and
blocks of luxurious flats, there was to-night an unaccustomed
coming and going of motor-cars, broughams, and
even democratic taxis. All these vehicles were making in
the same direction; and<!-- TN: original reads "and and" --> all were swallowed up by the
great gates that stood wide open before a private dwelling
standing just half way down the grand avenue that runs
between the city conservatories and the <span lang="fr">Bois</span>.</p>

<p>There for some months had been living the Grand Duchess
Alexandra, bosom friend of the King of <span lang="de">Hesse-Weimar</span>,
one of the most noted personalities of the foreign colony
in Paris. No one, in fact, making any pretence to belong to
society, could fail to be acquainted with the elegant and
enterprising grand duchess. All knew her as a pretty woman,
a wealthy woman, and report said a good and charitable
one; many a time her witty sayings had raised a laugh in
fashionable drawing rooms, while she enjoyed a reputation
for Parisian <i lang="fr">chic</i> that was certainly not unjustified.</p>

<p>Great lady as she was, there was something mysterious,
possibly equivocal, about her personality, and, if life in
Paris were not so stirring, so exacting, so absorbing, many
who frequented her receptions might well have asked who
precisely she was, and have searched curiously through the
pages of the <span lang="fr">Almanach de Gotha</span> to find the credentials for
her ducal blazon. The high rank she held at the Court of
Frederick Christian II was indeed matter of common
knowledge, further, that she was honoured by the very
special friendship of the Prince Gudulfin was whispered
in private conclave; but this pretty well summed up the
total of what society in general did know about her. But
<a id="png.183" href="#png.183"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>183<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it is never the custom, so long as a woman is rich, beautiful
and witty, so long as no open scandal attaches to her name,
to be over-exacting as to details? At any rate, each time
the grand duchess threw open her drawing rooms for one
of the superb and sumptuous entertainments she was in
the habit of giving, no eagerness was too shameless to
secure an invitation, no one but was only too proud and
happy to be numbered among her guests.</p>

<p>Though it was already May, the Grand Duchess Alexandra
was to-night giving a fancy-dress ball. This had long
been promised, but having been postponed in consequence
of the great lady’s being indisposed, was at last fixed for
this belated period of the season.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock, and guests were beginning to
arrive, carriages driving up in rapid succession to the steps
of the villa, one after the other depositing masked figures,
some baffling, some charming, in costumes borrowed from
legend, history, in some cases even recalling contemporary
politics. Dancing had not yet commenced, all were devoting
their energies to applauding, enthusiastically applauding,
the most becoming dresses, the most ingenious
disguises, as they appeared. The evening was delicious, the
mild spring weather perfect, so that the masquers could
gather under the wide awning that sheltered the steps and
there welcome each new arrival.</p>

<p>The general attention was beginning to flag, and the
duchess herself, abandoning the attempt to shake every new
arrival by the hand—their number made the task impossible—was
about to return to the reception rooms, where
the Gipsy orchestra had just struck up one of their softest
and most melodious waltz tunes, when a magnificent automobile
drew up at the steps. The car roused no little
curiosity by the fact that its blinds were drawn down so as
to make it impossible to see who was inside. Instinctively
almost, as sometimes happens, the talk grew hushed; heads
were turned and necks craned to see. Staying momentarily
the play of her ever-moving fan, the grand duchess herself
seemed to be puzzled as she eagerly awaited the newcomer,
whose very sex was still a secret.</p>

<p>Then the door of the car opened at last; and suddenly
through the crowd, till then so gay, ran a shudder of distress
and terror. “Ah, ahs!” of amazement could be heard, while
<a id="png.184" href="#png.184"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>184<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>even the hostess’s cheek paled. A striking, an extraordinary
figure it was that alighted from the mysterious equipage.
The costume, to be sure, was recognized by one and
all—but who, who had had the hardihood to don it?</p>

<p>In the dazzling illumination shed by the lights scattered
everywhere about the front of the mansion, the newcomer’s
figure stood out with extraordinary clearness. It was that
of a man, still young; he was clad from head to foot in a
complete suit of closely fitting black tights; his shoulders
were wrapped in a long cloak, also black, even his face
was hidden beneath a black cowl that prevented so much
as a guess at the colour of his hair.</p>

<p>A dreadful costume! a tragic figure! an emblem of fear!
The name of this mysterious masquer passed quickly from
lip to lip, set every heart beating fast and furiously, sounded
a grim refrain to every sentence spoken:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span><span class="ellips">!...</span> it is <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>But while his arrival was causing so great a sensation,
while the company, taken by surprise, showed itself afraid,
almost, panic-stricken almost, the unknown himself was advancing
to greet the Grand Duchess Alexandra. Bowing
low before his hostess with the manner of a finished gentleman,
in a grave, but agreeable voice:</p>

<p>“I was told, <span lang="fr">Madame la Duchesse</span>,” he said, “that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
attended every festivity. No sooner had I landed
in France than they swore to me he was afraid of nothing.
That is why I did not think it needful to warn you of
my coming to your fête. That is why I believed myself
justified in visiting you under <span class="prellips">this </span><span class="ellips">...</span> disguise.”</p>

<p>The Grand Duchess’s voice trembled a little as she questioned
him:</p>

<p>“But to whom have I the pleasure to be speaking?”</p>

<p>The masquer replied:</p>

<p>“To <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, madam!”</p>

<p>“To <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, of course<span class="ellips">!...</span> but besides?”</p>

<p>Clearly it would have been discourteous to carry on the
secret further. Indeed, the unknown had not failed to
note the half concealed fear, the very real distress, his
arrival had produced among the grand duchess’s guests.
To prolong this constraint would not have been becoming;
the “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>” therefore answered:</p>

<p>“Very good, madam, as it is your pleasure to unmask
<a id="png.185" href="#png.185"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>185<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>me, I cannot deny your wish, and I put off my <span class="prellips">cowl </span><span class="ellips">...</span>”—and
he lifted the silken folds concealing his features.
Next instant a tempest of applause, a tornado of acclamation,
from all present, greeted the hero of the hour. It was
indeed a fine piece of daring, a splendid stroke of defiance,
something quite Parisian and cynical, this grim disguise
adopted by the man who wore it. In the half minute he
stood there unmasked, he had been recognized. The
masquer who had put on the outward semblance of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
was no other than <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> declared enemy, no
other than Tom Bob!</p>

<p>Meantime the latter was bowing right and left, then
glided swiftly among the groups of his acquaintance,
grasping the men’s hands, kissing the ladies’, a very gallant
gentleman. A curious thing, too, to observe that, while
these fashionable men and women would never have condescended
to clasp hands with a common inspector of the
French Investigation Bureau, they were making much of
Tom Bob, just because he was a foreigner. True, he
had originally joined the police as an amateur, out of curiosity
and for the sake of amusement, and it was only by
degrees, after a series of notable successes, that he had
become a professional detective—and the fact was not
forgotten.</p>

<p>But the mystery was dissipated. After the inevitable
panic created by this apparition of the terrible figure of
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, a very real satisfaction, a genuine feeling of
relief had been experienced in learning that beneath this
horrid disguise was hidden the man who had pledged himself
to deliver Parisian society from <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! In fact
there was not one of all the grand duchess’s guests but
entertained in his heart a secret dread of the desperate
criminal. Ever since the brigand had sworn to the Parliament
to spread terror broadcast, every man felt himself
more or less menaced. The American detective, by taking
up the challenge thrown down by the Minister, had to
some extent relieved these apprehensions, and society was
grateful to him.</p>

<p>For half an hour the Grand Duchess Alexandra, like an
accomplished hostess, had been moving through the different
rooms, declining to dance herself, but finding for
each an agreeable word, a gracious phrase of greeting,
<a id="png.186" href="#png.186"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>186<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>when in a doorway by chance she came face to face with
the “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Bob,” she was beginning, when next moment
she broke off in startled surprise. And truly the great
lady had good reason to be amazed. The masquer, whom
she was about to congratulate once more on his clever
disguise, had just committed a grave breach of etiquette.
Bowing, he had, without a word, while pretending to kiss
her hand, slipped a note inside her glove. Then, turning on
his heels, not giving the grand duchess time to protest or
answer, he had glided off among the dancers, putting between
them the effective barrier of the whirling couples.</p>

<p>More than surprised, the grand duchess said and did
what any woman would have said and done under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Tom Bob dares to slip a <i lang="fr">billet doux</i> into my hand!
What insolence! Most certainly I will go and throw it
down at his feet, this execrable token of bad taste!” Then
she reflected that, before getting rid of the scrap of paper
she could feel under her glove, it would perhaps be amusing
to cast a glance at it, and, her lips curling in a disdainful
smile, the grand duchess, leaving the dancing rooms for a
moment, went up to her private apartment. There, hastily
turning on the electric light, she hurriedly glanced at the
extraordinary letter.</p>

<p>At first she thought she must be dreaming. The writing
was not Tom Bob’s: nor was it the detective, that was
certain, who had written on a corner of the paper by way
of address, and there was no other, the five words, “For
pity’s sake, read this!” Who was it then? Whose messenger
had Tom Bob constituted himself? The grand duchess
did not hesitate a second longer; unfolding the note, she
read, and the contents instantly blanched her cheeks:</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">“<i>Madam</i>,” the letter ran, “<i>you will pardon the means I
take to bring myself to your notice in consideration of the
feelings that prompt me. In the name of all you hold dear,
in the name of whatever pity your woman’s heart may know
for an unhappy lover, I beseech you to grant me your attention
for a few minutes this very evening. It is no enemy who
writes to you, albeit my name may make you shudder; it is
an unhappy man, an unhappy being who loves a young girl
<a id="png.187" href="#png.187"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>187<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>whom you know, one who cherishes no hope save in the
influence you can exert over her, one who, amidst these
merry-makers, under the black mask that veils his features,
will be impatiently waiting the moment when you shall accord
him the brief interview he asks, the brief minutes of
confidence he craves.</i>

<span class="sig"><span class="smc" lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>.”</span><!-- TN: closing quote invisible --></p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns"><span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>! The grand duchess thought she was
dreaming, was it indeed possible it could be <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>
who had written to her<span class="ellips">?...</span> <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, the ally of
<span lang="fr">Juve</span>? <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, the implacable enemy of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> whom all the world accused of
the vilest crimes, but whom <em>she</em> well knew to be innocent!
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, how that name evoked at once fear and
pity in the breast of that beautiful and mysterious personage,
the Grand Duchess Alexandra. What memories
did it not call up of the saddest tragedies of her life?</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, perhaps the only living being who could
possibly share with <span lang="fr">Juve</span> the knowledge that she, the
Grand Duchess Alexandra, was in reality named Lady
Beltham, was in reality the mistress of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! And
now it was this same <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, to-day her lover’s
implacable foe, to-morrow no doubt his accuser, who came
asking the favour of an interview! who asked the boon
in the name of love!</p>

<p>Lady Beltham stood trembling, her breath coming quick
and fast as she read and re-read the brief note just passed
to her. Then suddenly, shaking off all doubts, she made her
decision. Yes, seeing it was in the name of love that
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> wrote, seeing he besought her pity, she
would not refuse his prayer.</p>

<p>“My life, my unhappy life,” thought Lady Beltham,
“has but one excuse—love. Whensoever I hear that name
invoked, I shall be found ready to recognize the only sentiment
I feel some little respect for!”</p>

<p>But a bewildering, a terrible problem still confronted the
great lady; with what surprise, with what agitation she
realized that <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was in her house, and must be there,
the very terms of his letter showed it, disguised as <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>—in
the same disguise as Tom Bob? There were two
“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>” then among the dancers, the American detective
and <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>.</p>

<p><a id="png.188" href="#png.188"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>188<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>It was quite possible, quite probable indeed, as she soon
came to see. The costumes the detective and the journalist
had donned must obviously be alike, if they were correct:
was it not therefore allowable to suppose there were two
“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>” in the rooms without anyone having so far
noted the fact: naturally people would conclude it was the
same masquer they saw each time. Why, she herself was
deceived just now, believing herself in the presence of
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>-Tom Bob, when she was actually standing before
<span lang="fr">Fantômas-Fandor</span>!</p>

<p>Eventually Lady Beltham returned to the dancing rooms,
thinking to herself:</p>

<p>“I will go presently into the conservatory; he is sure to
be watching me and will join me there.”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">While the grand duchess in the retirement of her private
apartments was reading the strange note slipped into her
hand by <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, who had likewise come, as she had guessed,
disguised as <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, a diverting scene occurred in the
dancing rooms below! The fact is <span lang="fr">Fantômas-Fandor</span> had
caught sight of another <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.</p>

<p>“Halloa!” the young man told himself, “someone has
had the same idea as myself, it’s really capital!”</p>

<p>Then he disappeared in the crush, ready to keep a watchful
eye on Lady Beltham. But now the second <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>-Tom Bob, had also noted his double, and the
news was flying fast from mouth to mouth:</p>

<p>“You know, there are two <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span><span class="ellips">!...</span> a highly
original idea, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, highly original!” all agreed.</p>

<p>Yet no one observed that not merely two <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
were at the dance, but perhaps three or four, or even more!</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards, the lovely Sonia Danidoff was
waltzing with one of the men wearing the grim black cowl
when the second masquer clad in the same tragic garb
knocked against the couple; a dialogue verging on the
ludicrous ensued.</p>

<p>“Sir!” the first <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, Sonia’s partner, was saying,
“I think it a very bold proceeding to have adopted my
costume!”</p>

<p>“And why so, sir?” retorted<!-- TN: original reads "restorted" --> the other <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> in
the same emphatic tone.</p>

<p><a id="png.189" href="#png.189"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>189<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Because, sir, it is a heavy costume, and a dangerous
one, to wear! No brigand, save myself, had ever dreamt
of adopting it till you.”</p>

<p>To this the second masquer replied in a tone of raillery:
“You are in the wrong to complain, sir; it would more
become <em>me</em> to protest against <em>your</em> audacity. You are an
impostor, you carry a disguise. <em>I</em> am the genuine <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>“Easy talking, sir!”</p>

<p>“Easier still to prove, sir!”</p>

<p>“So it’s a quarrel, is it; we must settle between us, arms
in hand?”</p>

<p>“As you please, sir!”</p>

<p>“Now, at once?”</p>

<p>“At once!”</p>

<p>A laughing group had gathered round, finding a new
and piquant diversion in this altercation between the two
masquers, each defending with apparent seriousness his
title to be the true <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.</p>

<p>“The vanquished,” cried Sonia, merrily, “shall take off
his cowl for the rest of the evening.”</p>

<p>At this one of the disputants wheeled round, and in
answer to the gibe:</p>

<p>“No, madam,” he said, “the vanquished will not appear
again, for one good reason—he will be dead.”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">“Madam, I will use no empty words of compliment to
thank you for granting me this interview. Words are
incapable of translating my feelings, and between us they
would be yet more vain than with others.”</p>

<p>The “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>” who uttered the words bowed low with
infinite respect before the Grand Duchess Alexandra, whom
he had just come upon in one of the little nooks of greenery,
so quiet and retired, so convenient for flirtations or confidential
talks, which the great lady had contrived in the
superb winter garden, opening out of her drawing rooms.
The masquer went on:</p>

<p>“I will not thank you, madam, for on us, alas! weighs a
past too heavy to allow soft words to do aught but call
up sad memories in our hearts. That past you do not disown
any more than I do, but I ask your permission to remember
in speaking to you two facts, that you, you, the Grand
<a id="png.190" href="#png.190"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>190<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Duchess Alexandra, are Lady Beltham, and that I, under
this travesty of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, am <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>.”</p>

<p>In a weak, trembling voice, Lady Beltham questioned:</p>

<p>“Speak, sir! But first, why this disguise? why, why
do you, you of all men, wear that cowl?”</p>

<p>“Because, that mask, madam,” returned <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, in a
broken voice, “that mask lets me remain nameless among
your guests. Probably you forget, Lady Beltham, that
at this present moment <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> is held by general
consent to be a criminal. And, besides this, madam, yet
another reason—you will forgive my naming it—led me
to adopt this disguise. Was I not certain you would accord
a few minutes’ talk to the man wearing this costume. I
could not tell if it would be possible for me to give you the
letter; but I felt convinced if as <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> I asked to speak
with<!-- TN: original reads "wth" --> you, you would not refuse your lover three minutes’
conversation.”</p>

<p>Lady Beltham, pale and trembling, made no reply—what
answer could the unhappy lady find to give <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>,
the man who at that very time was suffering the direst
torments at the hands of the real <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, her lover?
She could only repeat again: “Speak, sir, what do you want
of me?”</p>

<p>“A small thing, madam,” returned <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, “a small
thing, and yet of infinite moment—<em>happiness</em>. I am going
to beg you to say three words—three words that will
assure me the chiefest joy of my life.”</p>

<p>Almost on the defensive, in a voice of fear, Lady Beltham
said for the third time: “Speak, sir, speak!”</p>

<p>“Madam,” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> resumed in trembling accents, “I
love deeply, with all my heart and all my soul, an unhappy
young girl whose name you know, for it bears a melancholy
renown. <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>, I mean. Madam, by your
lover’s doing—nay, never protest, all denial is in vain between
us—by your lover’s doing, I, I <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, am
deemed by <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>, as by all men, to be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.
She would love me if she knew me innocent, now
she hates me, fears me, flies from me! Madam, I have
always been to you, and even to him who is dear to you,
an honourable foe, the dreadful penalty I suffer to-day as
the result of the war I wage is the more cruel as it is
undeserved. What hurt can it do you, Lady Beltham,
<a id="png.191" href="#png.191"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>191<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>what hurt can it do <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, even should I enjoy a little
happiness, should I win <span lang="fr">Elisabeth’s</span> love<span class="ellips">?...</span> This is the
prayer I would make to you; she is single-hearted, she is
enthusiastic, she sacrifices my life to you; madam, I pray
you, I beseech you, go to <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> and tell her I am
not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, and that she can love me!”</p>

<p>Such profound feeling inspired <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor’s</span> words,
his voice vibrated with such deep emotion, as he spoke, that
Lady Beltham herself could not help being greatly moved.
Yes, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> was surely right, he had always been
an honourable enemy. Surely he was right again in describing
his position with <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> as horrible. Surely
again, what harm could it do <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> for him to enjoy
a little happiness?</p>

<p>Lady Beltham was touched, won over; she burst out
suddenly:</p>

<p>“I know you are <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, sir; I know it, and I
need only know that! I decline to understand the allusions
you have made. But if you beseech the Grand Duchess
Alexandra to go to <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>, the grand duchess is
verily too much your friend, too well persuaded of the
depth of your love for <span lang="fr">Mlle. Dollon</span>, to refuse the boon
you ask of her.”</p>

<p>“Oh! madam,”—and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, with a quick almost instinctive
movement, seized Lady Beltham’s white, ungloved
hand. But the great lady drew back, manifestly she could
not prolong for ever her talk with this masquer, this “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.”
None had come to disturb them, but their
conversation was bound to have attracted notice; the place
was lined with mirrors, they were at the mercy of every
chance reflection.</p>

<p>“Where can I see <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>?” asked the grand
duchess.</p>

<p>“The poor girl,” replied the other, “in spite of her enemies,
still lives an honest, hard-working life; I know—I
learnt this only a day or two ago—she is engaged as cashier,
I think at one of the restaurants in the <span lang="fr">Bois</span>, the restaurant
on the island in the lake.”</p>

<p>Lady Beltham had already risen and was moving away
when she threw these words by way of adieu to the young
man:</p>

<p>“By all I hold most sacred, sir, I swear that <span lang="fr">Elisabeth
<a id="png.192" href="#png.192"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>192<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Dollon</span>, no later than to-morrow evening, shall know that
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> is worthy of her love.”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">“I beg your pardon, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>“You mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean to say that costume is heavy for your shoulders.”</p>

<p>After Lady Beltham’s departure, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> had
stayed behind in the conservatory, motionless, wrapt in
absorption. The great lady’s promise had given him the
wildest hopes. If the grand duchess saw fit to convince
<span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> of his innocence, it was easy enough for
her to do so; if she kept her promise, and <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>
never doubted she would, a happy future, a future of love
lay before him! But as he was thinking these rosy thoughts,
plunged in an ecstasy of anticipation a disquieting incident
befell.</p>

<p>The young man was standing in the centre of the winter-garden,
on the very spot where he had talked with Lady
Beltham. On every side of him, on the walls, between the
interlacing boughs of palms, araucarias<!-- TN: original reads "araucasias" --> and kentias, hung
mirrors reflecting his own image and that of his surroundings.
Now, amid these reflections, appeared one, a second
“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,” that moved and gesticulated and presently
advanced, while the same mocking words, spoken now for
the second time in the course of the evening, struck on
<span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> ear:</p>

<p>“That cloak is heavy for your shoulders, sir!”</p>

<p>The journalist felt a cold sweat bedew his temples. Who
was this other “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>”? for it was in very truth, a
second “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>” advancing to meet him! the same
perhaps he had observed among the dancers just now?
or else, perhaps, another, or <span class="prellips">else </span><span class="ellips">...</span> or else<span class="ellips">....</span> In a
supercilious, defiant tone, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> retorted:</p>

<p>“If the cloak is heavy for my shoulders, sir, is it, pray,
any lighter for yours?”</p>

<p>“They are, at least better used to wearing it.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> started at the words, but before he had time to
answer, suddenly, in an instant, with an unparalleled swiftness
and violence that disarmed all power of resistance, a
savage dagger thrust caught him immediately over the heart.
A red mist blinded the young man’s eyes, as he staggered
under the force of the blow. A buzzing filled his ears, and a
<a id="png.193" href="#png.193"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>193<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>curse, a cry of fury, escaped his quivering lips. Then slowly
the place began to turn round and round, darkening and
taking on fantastic shapes; <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> was fainting.</p>

<p>But he was too energetic, too brave a man, to lose consciousness
for long. Three seconds after the blow was
struck, his senses were returning to him. “<span lang="fr">Fantômas!
Fantômas!</span>” he stammered: “it was the real <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
stood there before me!” He struggled painfully to his
knees, then rose to his feet in spite of the sharp pain, and
forced himself to look round—the conservatory was empty!
Stumbling forward, he took two or three steps, his hand
pressed to his breast, then sank into a rocking-chair, muttering
in a weak and still bewildered voice:</p>

<p>“Lucky for me, all the same, the coat of mail I took
the precaution to wear under my disguise withstood the
stab! I knew, when I put on this <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> costume, I
was risking the brigand’s anger; I was well advised to
guard against it as I did. Verily, I believe this time I have
looked death close in the face!”</p>

<p>Meantime in the ballrooms the festivities were still in
full swing while these untoward events were happening in
the winter-garden, but at last the dance was now drawing
to a close. Four o’clock was striking, and the wan, pallid
light of day peeped in at the doors half open into the park:
the loveliest faces began to look faded, the smoothest locks
ruffled, it was time for pretty women to beat a retreat,
under pain of seeming positively plain.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, no one knowing whence the news came,
all stood frozen in rigid horror at a dreadful report that
circulated from group to group. There was a general rush
for the park, while broken phrases passed between the
hurrying guests.</p>

<p>“Wounded?”</p>

<p>“Dead!”</p>

<p>“You are sure, madam?”</p>

<p>“It was a chauffeur found the body.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a dagger was still stuck in the heart.”</p>

<p>“Appalling!”</p>

<p>“So it wasn’t Tom Bob, then?”</p>

<p>“Who <em>was</em> the victim?”</p>

<p>“It is not known.”</p>

<p>“Where are the ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>’?”</p>

<p><a id="png.194" href="#png.194"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>194<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“One of them has just gone.”</p>

<p>“Who? which?”</p>

<p>“The cloak-room attendant recognized him; it was Tom
Bob.”</p>

<p>“It seems he was wounded?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the attendant said he had blood on his sleeve;
he had actually turned back the sleeve and looked at his
arm; there was a long, red gash there.”</p>

<p>“But Tom Bob is no assassin!”</p>

<p>“Ah! but was it really Tom Bob? that is just the
question, my dear sir.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> still lay exhausted in the conservatory, still dazed
from the attempt on his life he had only just escaped. But
in a moment he sprang up with a start, the Grand Duchess
Alexandra, Lady Beltham, stood before him. She looked
agitated, she was panting and frightfully pale.</p>

<p>“Fly! fly!” she cried distractedly.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> looked at the great lady in wide-eyed
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Fly! fly!” she could only repeat. “Oh! for pity’s sake,
begone! It is horrible, appalling they have just found in
the park a man dressed as <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> lying dead, stabbed to
the heart—an officer of the Criminal Investigation Bureau!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> listened without a word, while Lady Beltham went
on again, wringing her hands:</p>

<p>“But fly, I tell you, fly! Don’t you understand they
will accuse you? You were seen just now, dressed as
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, leaving the rooms with another ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>’,
they will make sure the first masquer was the murderer,
that is you!”</p>

<p>Still dazed as he followed Lady Beltham, who was leading
him towards a hidden door, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> asked:</p>

<p>“But then there were three ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>’?—Tom Bob,
myself, this officer?”</p>

<p>“There were four or five,” replied Lady Beltham, “I
cannot tell how many: there was you, there was Tom
Bob, there was an officer of the <span class="prellips">Bureau </span><span class="ellips">...</span> there <span class="prellips">was </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> finished the sentence the grand duchess dared
not complete. “There <span class="prellips">was </span><span class="ellips">...</span> there was,” he hesitated,
“there must have been the true <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>A malediction rose to <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor’s</span> lips, but all ready
<a id="png.195" href="#png.195"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>195<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to make his escape as Lady Beltham urged him, he yet
stayed his flight an instant; he had heard, like a benison
the unhappy woman murmur a parting word.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, to-morrow! I have promised you <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>
shall know you are innocent!”</p>

 ><small>“<span lang="fr">FANTÔMAS</span> SPEAKING!”</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc" lang="fr">M. Havard</span> was almost apologetic, almost polite, a fact
which in his case was proof positive of the deepest respect.
Habitually plain-spoken, accustomed to give orders in clear,
precise terms, and to ask questions in a more downright
fashion, still, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> appeared for once to be making
heroic efforts to preserve a respectful, deferential attitude.</p>

<p>“My carriage is not over and above luxurious,” he was
saying, pointing to the inside of the brougham in which
he had just taken his seat in company with a personage of
a keen, anxious-looking countenance, “<!-- TN: opening quote invisible -->but you must know
that, to make up, it is one of the safest.”</p>

<p>“What does that mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that, copying the Emperor of Germany, I have
taken the precaution, <span lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre</span>, to have the
woodwork lined with steel plates. In my carriage one is
secure against the latest and most approved revolvers, the
sharpest daggers.”</p>

<p>The Minister smiled approvingly. “And that is always
something!” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is indeed something,” <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> proceeded,
“when, like me, a man is continually exposed to acts of
vengeance, of reprisal, the object of ill-will and hatred.”</p>

<p>But it was pretty plain the Minister was paying but a
divided attention to <span lang="fr">M. Havard’s</span> remarks.</p>

<p>“Quite right,” he said, in an indifferent voice; “yes, I
admire your precautions; you were certainly well inspired
to fortify your carriage in this way<span class="ellips">....</span> But come now,
tell me what line you propose to adopt with this individual?”</p>

<p>“The individual we are going to see?”</p>

<p>“Precisely, this man Tom <span class="prellips">Bob </span><span class="ellips">...</span> this Tom Bob who
would seem to be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>—ridiculous as the supposition
may appear at first sight.”</p>

<p><a id="png.197" href="#png.197"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>197<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>On hearing this remark, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> was suddenly afflicted
with a very convenient tickling in the throat. He
said nothing—the Head of the Investigation Department
would, under no circumstances, have taken upon himself
to contradict a Minister of State, <span class="prellips">but </span><span class="ellips">...</span> well, he coughed.
And to cough, in all the languages of the world, has always
indicated that a man would not be disinclined to prove
his interlocutor mistaken in the opinions he is enunciating
in his presence.</p>

<p>Observing the police official’s hesitation, the Minister
insisted:</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Tom Bob must be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! The thing
is self-evident, obvious; don’t <em>you</em> think so, too, <span lang="fr">Havard</span>?”</p>

<p>For, impossible as it seemed to admit that Tom Bob
was really <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, the Minister had almost come to
believe it—to wish to believe it at any rate, since the tragic
events of the previous night! On the other hand, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>,
more accustomed to think things out coldly and
impartially, to weigh the arguments for and against a
proposition, was less convinced. “Events,” he reflected,
“do certainly seem to show Tom Bob to be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.
But there are so many facts on the other side that go to
prove the contrary that we must not rush to so extravagant
a conclusion. Deuce take it, Tom Bob is a police-officer—an
officer of repute in America; he has already, here in
Paris, since his arrival, effected some telling arrests<span class="ellips">....</span>
No, he cannot be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! If appearances are against
him, they are, after all, only appearances, probably contrived
by the real <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. It is true<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> broke off his reflections to answer the Minister’s
question:</p>

<p>“Alas! sir, in all these baffling difficulties, I really do
not know what I think.”</p>

<p>“A very canny answer.”</p>

<p>“But a sincere one, sir.”</p>

<p>“Sincere, why, yes, I grant you; but surely not very
frank. However, I will force you to give a plain reply—yes
or no, do you believe Tom Bob is the murderer?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> coughed again; it was evidently a chronic
complaint, this cough of his! Finally, sinking back in
discouragement on the cushions and nervously cracking his
finger joints, he confessed in a dubious voice:</p>

<p><a id="png.198" href="#png.198"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>198<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Believe! what do I believe<span class="ellips">?...</span> well, I just make
guesses, Monsieur le Ministre.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear man, you told me <span class="prellips">yourself </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>” then
breaking off again, the Minister started afresh.</p>

<p>“Come, tell me the exact particulars—I have so much
business on my mind there are times when I cannot trust
my own memory—tell me the precise results of your investigations.
You were saying that <span class="prellips">yesterday </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>This time, when it became a question of setting out the
results of a police investigation, without deducing the
consequences, without drawing any compromising conclusion,
<span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> recovered all his usual coolness, all the
peremptory tone of authority that was habitual with him.
So it was with perfect lucidity, with the strictest logical
precision, he now answered the Minister.</p>

<p>“My investigation has established nothing absolutely
definite. All it justifies us in doing is to specify certain
facts, relevant facts I admit, but in no way conclusive.”</p>

<p>“And these facts are<span class="ellipsp">?...</span>”</p>

<p>“These facts are as follows: Yesterday, the Grand
Duchess Alexandra gave a ball, a costume ball. At this
costume ball were several ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.’ How many, precisely,
it is impossible, sir, for me to inform you; I have
not been able to ascertain the number. On more than one
occasion, this is certain, two masked figures, two ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>’
were seen talking together, which would go to prove
there were <em>two</em> ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>’; but after all, this is not positively
certain, for because two men in black cowls have
been seen, it obviously does not follow there were no others
elsewhere in the rooms<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>“But why this hypothesis?”</p>

<p>“Why? h’m! <span class="prellips">because </span><span class="ellips">...</span><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis --> Anyhow, sir, let us remember
this fact, this primary fact—two ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,’ exactly alike,
two disguises of identical shape and make, attended the
Grand Duchess Alexandra’s fête. Very good, but who and
what were they? Here we enter the domain at once of
certainties and hypotheses. One certainly we have—one
of these masquers was Tom Bob; he was seen, recognized,
identified by name. The second of these masqued men,
and here we have another, a melancholy, certainty, was an
agent of the Criminal Bureau, one of our excellent officers,
indeed, Inspector <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>—he was the man they found
<a id="png.199" href="#png.199"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>199<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>subsequently, you know, under the trees in the garden, stabbed
to the heart.”</p>

<p>“And he was the man,” affirmed the Minister, “who was
seen to go off with Tom Bob, with the other ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,’
after a laughing colloquy, in which our agent, like Tom Bob,
had claimed to be actually and indeed the ever-elusive
brigand. From which I <span class="prellips">infer </span><span class="ellips">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>But <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> made a gesture of dissent:</p>

<p>“Yes, you infer, sir, but you go too fast in your inferences.
What precisely occurred between the moment when
Tom Bob as ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>’ arrived at the grand duchess’s, a
little before our agent <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>, also disguised as a ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,’
and that when the unfortunate officer was found dead, murdered?
It would be hard to say. You remember the
laughing dispute that took place between the two ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>’?
That dispute actually took place; my investigation
has enabled me to find many who can vouch for it, amongst
other witnesses the Princess Sonia Danidoff. I do not dispute
it, but you miss one point, <span lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre</span>, and
that is that when the two men made a pretence of going
into the park to settle their difference arms in hand, both
wore the sinister black cowl, and could not therefore be
recognized, and that in consequence there is nothing to
justify our alleging that the man who was with the
unfortunate <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> was really Tom Bob.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, there <em>is</em> one <span class="prellips">thing </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>“Namely, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, think, the incident in the cloak room<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> smiled.</p>

<p>“I do not forget it!” he cried, “yes, the cloak room
incident does constitute a serious impeachment against
Tom Bob, a terribly serious impeachment. But you remember
the exact details, sir?”</p>

<p>“I think so! Come, now, events happened <span class="prellips">thus </span><span class="ellips">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>“I will detail them precisely as they did happen. At
the very moment at which the chauffeur found the murdered
<span lang="fr">Joffre’s</span> body in the gardens, the rumour was circulating
among the dancers, a well-founded rumour, that Tom
Bob, Tom Bob, still wearing his ‘<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>’ costume,
had just left. If we are to credit the cloak room attendant,
he had come in a few minutes before to claim back the
black mantle that covered his shoulders on his first arrival,
<a id="png.200" href="#png.200"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>200<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and which he had entrusted to the man’s care in the
course of the evening. Now, as he put on the garment,
Tom Bob would appear to have mentioned that he was
wounded in the arm, and on the man expressing surprise,
he would seem to have gone on to say: ‘It’s the penalty
for having chosen to play up a bit too hard against the real
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.’ Then, still going by what the attendant says,
he seems to have pulled up his sleeve, unbuttoned his
cuff, and—the cloak room was empty at the moment—examined
a deep cut on his arm, half way between shoulder
and elbow, to be precise, a cut apparently made by
a knife, and which, moreover, was still bleeding freely.
Tom Bob seems after that to have pulled down the
sleeve again, declaring it was a trifle, and so taken his
departure.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> fell silent, the Minister seemed to be thinking,
then suddenly he asked:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>, why do you speak in the conditional
mood<span class="ellips">?...</span> Tom Bob <em>would appear</em> to have done such
and such a thing, said such and such a thing: <em>seems</em> to
have taken his departure! So you don’t believe the witness
to be trustworthy?”</p>

<p>This time, <span lang="fr">M. Havard’s</span> habit of plain speaking took the
upper hand, and it was in a tone by no means over and
above respectful that he replied:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do! The witness is telling the truth, the
story is quite correct. But if I do speak in the conditional,
the real fact is all these happenings, all this evidence
about the wound, is <span class="prellips">so </span><span class="ellips">...</span> so odd, so improbable,
<span class="prellips">that </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“How improbable?” protested the Minister, “Why, sir,
if <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> <em>was</em> murdered, I take it he was not killed without
defending himself; even if he received a mortal blow quite
unexpectedly, he could have struck back, wounded Tom
Bob, wounded his assailant<span class="ellips">....</span>”</p>

<p>In a tone of raillery, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> finished the other’s
sentence:</p>

<p>“<span class="ellips">...</span> And <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> could have committed the imprudence
of boasting of it in the cloak room? But, my
dear sir, that is foolishness, utter foolishness! I won’t so
much as think of it! If Tom Bob was <span lang="fr">Joffre’s</span> murderer,
he would be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>; if he was <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, he would
<a id="png.201" href="#png.201"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>201<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>never have been guilty of the mad inconsistency of showing
his wound to a witness.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard’s</span> objection was evidently well founded, the
whole story was undoubtedly baffling. But the Minister
still refused to confess himself beaten. <em>He</em> believed in
Tom Bob’s guilt. Had the detective not been seen in
the “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>” costume? Was he not known to have had
an altercation with <span lang="fr">Joffre</span>, to have gone off in his company
into the gardens, where <span lang="fr">Joffre</span> had been killed. Nothing,
if not logical, the Minister drew the conclusion: “Tom Bob
is the murderer.”</p>

<p>Then another point struck him, and he added triumphantly:</p>

<p>“Besides, <span lang="fr">Havard</span>, if Tom Bob were not guilty, why
should he not have come in answer to your invitation this
morning?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> shook his head doubtfully, and made no
answer. This point, raised by the Minister’s last question,
was precisely what most exercised the head of the Investigation
Department. When at an early hour he had been
awakened by a ring on the telephone and a message from
the Commissary’s office at the <span lang="fr">Parc des Princes</span>, telling
him that a new and appalling crime had just been committed
by <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, a crime that was spreading frantic terror
among the members of Parisian society, a crime that it
seemed must be set down to Tom Bob, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> had
come to several important decisions. He telephoned immediately
to the Prefecture to send officers of the Department
to shadow the <span lang="fr">Hôtel Terminus</span>, where Tom Bob was
still in residence. For himself, he set off at once to the
Grand Duchess Alexandra’s. There he had, with his usual
ability and acumen, held a rapid investigation, in the
course of which he had discovered certain facts, facts if
not directly relevant, at least suggestive.</p>

<p>On leaving the villa in the <span lang="fr">Parc des Princes, M. Havard</span>
hurried to the Ministry of Justice. It was eight o’clock
when the head of the Criminal Bureau reached the Minister’s
private apartments. By dint of eager representations to
the ushers on duty and a like insistence with the ministerial
<i lang="fr">attachés</i>, he obtained immediate audience of <span lang="fr">M. Désiré
Ferrand’s</span> successor. A few moments more and he was
closeted with the Minister of Justice, and was rapidly
<a id="png.202" href="#png.202"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>202<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>narrating, almost without drawing breath, the extraordinary
events of the previous evening.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre,” M. Havard</span> concluded, “I
deemed it expedient to put you in possession of the facts
at once, in order to save myself from incurring too heavy
a load of responsibility; at this present moment a man
is suspected, and reasonably suspected; this man is Tom
Bob, the American detective. Unless we arrest him, public
opinion, alarmed, agitated, terror-stricken, is going to cause
us the most troublesome embarrassments; questions will
be asked in the House, for certain! On the other hand, to
arrest Tom Bob is a serious step; he is an American citizen,
a foreigner, and will no doubt claim the protection of his
consul and involve us in diplomatic difficulties. In fact,
to arrest the man seems a monstrous thing to do.”</p>

<p>The Minister, after a few minutes’ thought, advised <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> to despatch a special messenger to see Tom Bob
and beg him to come at once to the Ministry of Justice
where the Minister wished to speak to him. But the messenger
had been to the <span lang="fr">Hôtel Terminus</span>, had seen Tom Bob,
and had brought back the answer:</p>

<p>“Mr. Bob directs me to say he is very tired, almost ill,
and cannot be disturbed.”</p>

<p>Neither <span lang="fr">Havard</span> nor the Minister could make anything
of it, and while the former was still marvelling at the
amazing attitude the American detective had chosen to
adopt in refusing to obey the personal invitation of a
Minister of State, under the flimsy excuse of fatigue, the
Minister insisted:</p>

<p>“You must admit, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, that this refusal to come
and see me is, to say the least, extraordinary. Why, deuce
take it, if Tom Bob was not wounded, that is to say, was
not guilty, that is to say, had not pressing reasons for
not showing himself just now, he would have come along
here post haste. How did he know I was not meaning to
decorate him?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> laughed frankly at the great man’s little
joke; he was still laughing when the brougham stopped at
the door of the <span lang="fr">Hôtel Terminus</span>.</p>

<p>“Whatever you do,” the Minister observed, as they got
out, “whatever you do, address me as ‘my dear fellow,’ from
now on. I don’t at all like the idea of that American being
<a id="png.203" href="#png.203"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>203<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>able to boast of having put out a Minister of France. I
mean to preserve the strictest incognito.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> handed his card to a waiter, bidding him go
and inform Mr. Tom Bob that he desired a few minutes’
conversation with him; then, after the man had gone, he
assured his companion:</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid, <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre </span><span class="ellips">...</span> beg pardon<span class="ellips">!...</span>
do not be afraid, my dear fellow: nobody shall
guess who you are.”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">“<span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>, I was expecting you”—smiling,
cheerful, debonair, not the very least like a sick or tired
man, Tom Bob welcomed <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> in one of the small
sitting rooms of the hotel.</p>

<p>“You were expecting me, my dear colleague?”</p>

<p>“Certainly!”</p>

<p>Then, as Tom Bob was drawing up seats, and his eyes
fell on the Minister, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> thought it needful to add:
“Allow me to introduce my senior secretary.”</p>

<p>The American vouchsafed a little supercilious smile for
this subordinate. “Delighted, sir, delighted to meet you!”
and he turned again to <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, resuming:</p>

<p>“I was expecting you, because I supposed the Minister,
having sent for me this morning and finding I did not come,
would send someone to see me.”</p>

<p>The opportunity was too good a one for verifying an
important point for <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> to neglect:</p>

<p>“You were right, quite right in your supposition. But,
by-the-by, why did you not come to the Ministry?”</p>

<p>A smile appeared on Tom Bob’s lips; with his usual
phlegm he answered <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>:</p>

<p>“And pray, why should I have gone?”</p>

<p>The reply was so startling in its quiet unconcern that
the Head of the Criminal Bureau was struck dumb for a
moment. However, he quickly recovered his self-possession
and answered back:</p>

<p>“Why, my dear sir, <span class="prellips">because </span><span class="ellips">...</span> because when a Minister
sends for one, surely one ought to take the trouble to
obey.”</p>

<p>But Tom Bob, quite unruffled, only shrugged his
shoulders. Taking a cigarette from his case, he lit it without
a sign of embarrassment, then:</p>

<p><a id="png.204" href="#png.204"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>204<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“You think so?” he said, “well, I think the opposite!
If we differ in our ideas, it is probably because you, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, are you, purely French: and I, Tom Bob, equally
American.”</p>

<p>“Which means?”</p>

<p>“Which means,” concluded the detective, with his Yankee
bluntness, “that having nothing to say to the Minister,
I did not feel any need to go and see him, and I considered
if he wanted to speak to me, that he might very well take
the trouble to come as far as the <span lang="fr">Hôtel Terminus</span>.”</p>

<p>Listening to this speech of the phlegmatic American,
<span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> turned first pale, then green, sorely embarrassed
as he remembered they were spoken actually before the
Minister’s very face. The interview was taking an unpleasant
complexion and it was best to push into other
matters: “Tell me, my dear Bob,” he asked by way of
turning the conversation, and getting back to serious affairs,
“you can guess, I take it, why I have come this
morning?”</p>

<p>Immediately Tom Bob’s face lost its look of calm unconcern;
it was evident a genuine curiosity pricked the
detective as he replied:</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I don’t, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>! I know
nothing at all about it, though I must confess it interests
me very <span class="prellips">greatly </span><span class="ellips">...</span> Could I be of any use to you, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>The Head of the Criminal Bureau, after a moment’s
pause, and speaking sharply and incisively in a way to
throw the other off his guard:</p>

<p>“Useful?” he exclaimed, “yes, you can be very useful
to me”—and, almost showing his cards, he demanded:</p>

<p>“I expect you to give me an explanation of last night’s
events.”</p>

<p>“Last night’s events?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the tragedy that happened at the Grand Duchess
Alexandra’s.”</p>

<p>“A tragedy happened?”</p>

<p>“In a word, I want you to tell me how your wound is.”</p>

<p>“My wound<span class="ellips">?...</span> why, you are gone crazy, <span lang="fr">Monsieur
Havard</span>!”</p>

<p>“Crazy indeed! but, <span class="prellips">now </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“What on earth are you talking about now?” Tom
<a id="png.205" href="#png.205"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>205<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Bob’s face wore such an expression of amazement, stupefaction,
utter lack of comprehension, that with one accord
<span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> and the Minister, who had to hold himself in
hand hard to keep his lips shut, sprang up and faced the
detective.</p>

<p>“But,” screamed <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, boiling over with exasperation,
“but you are not, I presume, going to deny that
yesterday evening you were at the Grand Duchess Alexandra’s
ball?”</p>

<p>Tom Bob struck his breast in perfectly unaffected
surprise.</p>

<p>“I?” he stammered, “<em>I</em> was at the Grand Duchess
Alexandra’s ball!”</p>

<p>“Egad! yes: as <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, come now!”</p>

<p>“And as <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! But, really, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>, I
don’t understand one word you are saying. I have never
been in the Grand Duchess Alexandra’s house, neither
at her dance, nor at any other time: neither yesterday, nor
ever before!”</p>

<p>“And you are not wounded?”</p>

<p>“Wounded where?”</p>

<p>“In the arm.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob took off his coat and pulled up both his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>“There, look!” he cried, “where can you see a wound?”—and
he passed his hand across his forehead, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Why, whatever do you mean, in God’s name! I think
I must be dreaming!”</p>

<p>This time, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> and the Minister gazed at each
other in doubt and bewilderment. Tom Bob was not
wounded! Tom Bob had not been at the grand duchess’s
ball! Tom Bob was dumbfounded at the mere mention
of their suspicions. It was beyond everything.</p>

<p>Then the Minister took up his parable. “Listen, Monsieur
Bob,” he said “we are <em>not</em> crazy. This is what
occurred, this is what we <span class="prellips">believed </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>At great length, with details confirmed by <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>,
with endless comments, the Minister narrated the whole
incomprehensible imbroglio of the preceding evening, and
at the end waited anxiously for the detective to speak.</p>

<p>“Come now,” he demanded, “do you understand anything
about it all?”</p>

<p><a id="png.206" href="#png.206"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>206<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Tom Bob shook his head. “No!” he declared, in a
preoccupied tone of voice and with a meditative air, “no,
I know nothing—or rather, from what you tell me, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, and you, <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But at this mention of his rank, the Minister started
violently. “What!” he exclaimed, “then you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! yes, I know. Pardon me, but I know perfectly
well I have the honour to address the Minister of
Justice. Egad, with Tom Bob, I assure you, there is no
incognito can last long. But enough of that—I was going
to tell you there is only one thing I do understand in
all these tragic and bloody accidents that befell at the
grand duchess’s <span class="prellips">ball </span><span class="ellips">...</span>”</p>

<p>“And that is?”</p>

<p>“Just this,” declared the detective, “that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
was present at the ball and that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> made himself
out to be me, Tom Bob: that it was actually <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
who was wounded, that he boasted of it out of a criminal’s
vanity who takes his impunity as a matter of course. And,
that he committed a blunder, after all, for this wound in
the arm will help us to identify him the more easily.”</p>

<p>But now, as Tom Bob finished speaking, the Minister
and <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> exchanged a meaning look; both had been
struck by the same idea.</p>

<p>“Egad!” <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> spoke in a low voice, almost as
if talking to himself, “egad! if Mr. Bob is right, we
shall have the means, once and for all, of clearing up all
these matters. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is in prison, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Juve </span><span class="ellips">...</span> if <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is wounded!”</p>

<p>But the Minister broke in: “Yes, <span lang="fr">Havard</span>, you are
right; <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, then it is <span lang="fr">Juve</span> must be wounded.
But inasmuch as <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is in the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite> prison, inasmuch as
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> is in gaol, he was not, he could not be, at the Grand
Duchess Alexandra’s ball yesterday!”—and as if the
better to strengthen his conviction, the Minister repeated
in a loud, emphatic voice:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is in gaol! What the deuce, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is
in gaol!”</p>

<p>Tom Bob was going to reply, when the door opened,
and a man-servant put in his head to announce:</p>

<p>“If you please, <span lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Bob, you are wanted at the
’phone—someone who declines to give his name.”</p>

<p><a id="png.207" href="#png.207"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>207<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The detective got up, took two or three steps as if to
leave the room, then observing there was a telephone instrument
standing on a side-table near at hand, he told
the servant: “Very good, my man, put me through here,
will you?”—and turning to the Minister and <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>,
who sat buried in their own thoughts: “Excuse me,” he
said, as he unhooked the receiver.</p>

<p>But he had hardly put the receiver to his ear before
Tom Bob started violently.</p>

<p>“One second!” he cried, “hello, just a second! will you
hold the line? I’m shutting a door so as to hear you
better.”</p>

<p>The detective laid down the receiver and turning quickly
to the Minister and <span lang="fr">M. Harvard</span>, he said in a mocking
voice:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is in gaol, you say? what a mistake! Do
you know who is telephoning me at this moment?”</p>

<p>“Not I!” said the Minister, looking up.</p>

<p>Tom Bob answered in half-a-dozen words, spoken with
all his usual phlegm, without so much as raising his voice:</p>

<p>“Well, the person now speaking to me is just simply
the man—just <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>And as the Minister and <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> looked at one another
incredulously, the detective, turning the instrument round,
politely offered one of the two receivers to the Minister,
keeping the other himself, and proceeded with the conversation
over the wires:</p>

<p>“Hello! Yes, I’m back again now; it is I, Tom Bob,
speaking. You say—will I excuse you for having borrowed
my personality? Why, certainly; it would be very poor
taste not to forgive you, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, for I must own it was
a stroke of genius! Hello! yes—you want to make it up
to me for the liberty you took? Yes, thank you. Hello!
what say? D’you mind repeating. Oh! you tell me, in
order to let me win a score off you in the eyes of
the Criminal Department, that to-night, this very evening,
something will be doing at the <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Restaurant Azaïs </span><span class="ellips">...</span> what
o’clock<span class="ellips">?...</span> seven<span class="ellips">!...</span> very good, thank you again!—I’ll
make a careful note of <span class="prellips">it </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I shall be <span class="prellips">there </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
hello! hello! are you there?”</p>

<p>But a blunder of the telephone girl had cut off connection,
and henceforth it was in vain Tom Bob repeated his
<a id="png.208" href="#png.208"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>208<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hello! hello! There was no answer. So he put down the
receiver, while the Minister also hung up his.</p>

<p>“Well!” remarked the detective, “you see, sir, we are
on the best of terms.”</p>

<p>The Minister seemed to be living in a nightmare; he
thought he was dreaming, perhaps going demented, and
it was in a weak voice he answered:</p>

<p>“But it’s a joke, all this, eh, Mr. Bob? It is not
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> ’phoning to you, come now!”</p>

<p>The detective shrugged: “Not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?” he said.
“Then who is it<span class="ellips">?...</span> who do you think it is?”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> would never tell you beforehand he was going
to commit a crime at this restaurant in the <span lang="fr">Bois</span>.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! if he’s sure, once more, of not being arrested?”</p>

<p>“No matter that! it would be too audacious; come, now,
Mr. Bob, you won’t go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I shall, sir! I shall be there.”</p>

<p>The Minister was thinking; suddenly he went on:</p>

<p>“Well, if you go, by all I hold most sacred, I will go
too! Yes, I will go! it shall never be <span class="prellips">said </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>Tom Bob turned to <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>: “And you, my dear
colleague, will you come? You seem pensive for the
moment?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> indeed—from Tom Bob’s answers he had
quite well gathered, or at any rate guessed, what <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
probably said—was thinking deeply.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he declared at last, “yes, I shall certainly go;
but it will be without over much belief in the thing.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“<span class="prellips">Because </span><span class="ellips">...</span> because it was a practical joker telephoned
you.”</p>

<p>“A practical joker? No, I don’t think that.”</p>

<p>“I do!” declared <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, who was getting annoyed,
“yes, a practical joker! a practical joker, I repeat, for,
look you, there is one thing you are forgetting, that we
are all forgetting at present, a fact that is certain, <span class="prellips">indisputable </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“To wit?”</p>

<p>“Why, that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is in prison, that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is
in the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite>, and that consequently he could not have done
murder yesterday, he cannot be telephoning to you now,
it will be impossible for him to be at the <cite lang="fr">Azaïs</cite> to-morrow<!-- TN: hyphen inserted for consistency -->!”</p>

<p><a id="png.209" href="#png.209"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>209<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The Minister, who for the last few minutes had been
getting more and more impatient, laid his hand on <span lang="fr">M. Havard’s</span> shoulder.</p>

<p>“Listen to me!” he said, “all this is very bewildering,
so bewildering in fact, that we are forgetting our logic.
There is one step we must take instantly. <span lang="fr">Monsieur
Havard</span>, in coming to see your colleague, to see Mr. Tom
Bob, we have made a blunder; it is elsewhere we must
go now. By the Lord, we shall soon see if <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is
wounded, we shall soon find out whether he telephoned
this morning, whether he can go this evening!”</p>

<p>Before the great man had done speaking, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>
had clapped on his hat again and slipped on his top-coat.</p>

<p>“You are right, Monsieur le Ministre,” he declared,
“let us go there at once.”</p>

 class="ns">[</span>210<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XIX<br
 ><small>THE PRISONER OF THE <span lang="fr">SANTÉ</span></small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">It</span> was the hour of general <i lang="fr">réveillée</i> at the prison of <cite lang="fr">La
Santé</cite>. Along the corridors, still in semi-darkness, tramped
the warders, jangling their ponderous bunches of keys, on
their way to wake the prisoners for the morning meal.
Before the door of the cell where <span lang="fr">Juve</span> was confined, <span lang="fr">Hervé</span>,
the turnkey, usually entrusted with the surveillance of the
ex-detective, stood hesitating, only finally making up his
mind to go in on hearing the step of a chief warder at the
far end of the paved passage.</p>

<p>The door turned slowly on its hinges. As a rule the
sound of the key turning in the lock was the signal for
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> to start wide awake and sit up in his bed, in eager
expectation <span class="prellips">of </span><span class="ellips">...</span> what? Perhaps his release! But alas!
morning after morning the apparition of the turnkey’s
sullen countenance only brought bitter disappointment
with it.</p>

<p>But this morning the prisoner did not wake; he was
sleeping heavily and, if appearances were to be trusted,
very uneasily. He kept groaning and crying out peevishly,
muttering incoherently, twisting and turning in his bed,
waving about his arms, one of which showed stains of
blood, blood that had run down in two red rivulets over
his torn shirt and marked the white sheet with little brown
spots.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Hervé</span> approached the bed and stood looking down at
the sleeper. The turnkey showed no particular signs of
surprise at seeing the condition his prisoner was in, but
wore rather the preoccupied look of a man who cannot
make up his mind to one course of action more than
another. Eventually, he shook the sleeper roughly, hauled
him up by the shoulder into a sitting posture, and when
the prisoner, though still looking dazed and rubbing his
<a id="png.211" href="#png.211"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>211<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>eyes sleepily, seemed more or less awake, apostrophized
him angrily:</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with you? where does that blood come
from?”</p>

<p>“Blood? Where do you see any blood?”</p>

<p>“There, on your arm, on your shirt, on your bed-sheet.
How came you to hurt yourself?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I hadn’t noticed it before; it must have
been in the night, I must have torn the skin tossing
about.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, that’s an impossible story! What could
you have done it with?”</p>

<p>“There, look at the corner of the bed, there’s a blood
stain there: that’s where I hurt myself, no doubt. I’ve
had a shocking night—bad dreams, nightmare: my head
aches, I feel tired out, I must have kicked about ever so
in my bed, it’s no wonder I knocked the skin off banging
my arm against one of the iron bars.”</p>

<p>“H’m! it don’t seem to me just as clear as daylight,
somehow. Anyway be quick and get dressed, I must report
to the Governor, and he’ll see what’s best to do.”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns"><span lang="fr">M. Chaigniste</span>, the able and well-known Governor of the
<cite lang="fr">Santé</cite> prison was in his working room, engaged in reading
through again a report he had drawn up the night before
on the general condition of his establishment; he was
rubbing his hands in token of satisfaction, equally pleased
with the elegance of his own composition and his skill as
an administrator that had enabled him up to the present
to avoid any, even the most trifling, of those “affairs” that
are the <i lang="fr">bête noire</i> of persons in authority, when the warder
appeared: “I’ve come, sir, to let you know I found
Number 55 wounded in his cell when I went there this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Number 55! Why, that’s <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, is it not, the ex-police-officer?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir.”</p>

<p>“Is it serious?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, only a bit of a cut on the arm.”</p>

<p>“Take him to the infirmary; I will go there myself, as
soon as the doctor arrives.”</p>

<p>At that very moment a bell tinkled in the Governor’s
<a id="png.212" href="#png.212"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>212<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>study; it was the house-porter ’phoning <span lang="fr">M. Chaigniste</span> that
Doctor <span lang="fr">Du Marvier</span> was come for his daily visit. The
Governor and the practitioner found <span lang="fr">Juve</span> in the waiting
room, sitting on a stool, holding his head between his
hands and puzzling over his wound, which struck him as,
after all, hard to account for. The doctor tapped him
lightly on the shoulder. He was a little round man, with
a merry face, a smile for ever on his lips, the very spirit
of gaiety, a man to heal his patients by the mere sight of
his beaming face! “My standing panacea,” he was in the
habit of saying, “is a funny story.”</p>

<p>Accordingly it was with a pleasantry he greeted the
ex-police-officer, with whom he had already come in contact
previously to his imprisonment.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter now? We’re not satisfied
with the Governor’s treatment of us, eh? so we go and
try to kill ourselves, is that it?”</p>

<p>“Doctor,” <span lang="fr">Juve</span> replied in the same vein; “I could
very readily dispense with the privilege of being <span lang="fr">Monsieur
Chaigniste’s</span> guest, but all the same I can assure you I
have not the smallest wish in the world to escape his
hospitality by committing suicide. I am just as much
surprised as anybody else at the wound in my arm. I can
only account for it by the supposition that in my sleep
I knocked up against a corner of my iron bedstead.”
While speaking, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had removed his jacket and turned
up his shirt sleeve. The wound was plainly visible, a clear
cut an inch or a trifle over in length on the upper part
of the arm pointing downwards. The trifling nature of the
hurt indeed made the doctor’s whimsical suggestion seem
utterly absurd—a man wanting to kill himself would set
about the job in quite another fashion.</p>

<p>But was <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> own hypothesis any more probable?
Was it against the corner of his bed the police-officer had
hurt himself while asleep? Evidently such was not the
view taken by the doctor, who after a rapid examination,
turned to the Governor, saying:</p>

<p>“The wound is quite superficial, the skin is only slightly
broken, and if the hurt has bled rather copiously, that is
only because one or two small veins have been divided.
With every confidence I can assure you the prisoner’s bed
has nothing whatever to do with the accident. It is a
<a id="png.213" href="#png.213"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>213<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cut is in question, and a cut that cannot have been made
by anything except an implement with a cutting edge.
A blow, as violent as is assumed, would have produced a
bruise, a swelling, the blood would have collected under
the epidermis, might indeed have spurted out, but we
should never have seen an incision so clean-cut as that.”</p>

<p>But whilst the doctor was speaking, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had turned as
pale as death; he seemed to have lost all power in his
limbs and sank down exhausted on a stool. Doctor <span lang="fr">Du
Marvier</span> was quick to notice the prisoner’s condition;
taking his hand he felt his pulse carefully.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said, “is your pulse so slow usually?”</p>

<p>“No, doctor, I have always supposed myself to have
a normally rapid pulse, but to-day I don’t feel quite well,
I slept very badly last night and I have a violent headache.”</p>

<p>“Let me see your tongue!” It was quite white, like
a man’s after a high fever. Then the doctor put his ear
to the prisoner’s heart; when he raised his head after a
long auscultation, he had apparently found the solution
of the problem, for a look of conviction illuminated his
face. Drawing the Governor on one side, he spoke to him
in a low voice. What he said must have been of the very
gravest import for, when he had done, the Governor was
as pale as <span lang="fr">Juve</span> himself and seemed to be profoundly
agitated. <span lang="fr">M. Chaigniste</span> was turning to the prisoner, no
doubt intending to question him further, when one of his
private servants came in to tell him:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, sir, is waiting in your room to speak to
you on some very urgent business.”</p>

<p>“I will go to him,” replied the Governor, and beckoning
to the warders:</p>

<p>“Take the man back to his cell,” he ordered, “and keep
him under observation.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> was much excited. His idea had been to
follow up his researches regarding the crime committed
at the grand duchess’s by satisfying himself as to <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span>
condition. Inasmuch as it was a proven fact that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
had been wounded in the arm, if <span lang="fr">Juve</span> was really
and truly <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, he argued, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> must be wounded.
Accordingly, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> had betaken himself to the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite>
prison. Well, scarcely had he arrived there before he
learned that the Governor and the doctor were with <span lang="fr">Juve</span>,
<a id="png.214" href="#png.214"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>214<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>who had been wounded in the night! It was the confirmation
of all his hypotheses; it was the new and unexpected
fact that should bring daylight into a laborious investigation,
hitherto anything but fruitful in results! <span lang="fr">Juve</span> was
verily and indeed <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! the ex-detective was the
most redoubtable of all malefactors! If he showed such
acuteness and sagacity in unravelling the most tangled
affairs, it was because the very crimes he brought to light
he had himself committed!</p>

<p>Easy to imagine with what impatience the Head of the
Criminal Bureau awaited <span lang="fr">M. Chaigniste’s</span> arrival! The
latter was hardly in the room before he sprang to meet
him:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span>! What ails him! He is wounded? wounded
where?”</p>

<p>The Governor was barely recovered from the agitation
caused him by the doctor’s startling announcement. So
it was in a rather shaky voice, and after a moment’s pause
to recover his self-possession, that he answered:</p>

<p>“He has given himself a slight, quite a slight wound.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“With an implement, knife or penknife, we do not
yet know which.”</p>

<p>“Whereabouts is the wound?”</p>

<p>“In the arm.”</p>

<p>“Why, the man’s a demon, nothing less!”</p>

<p>The Governor had no knowledge of the events that had
occurred the night before at the grand duchess’s, so he
was quite at a loss as to the meaning of <span lang="fr">M. Havard’s</span>
exclamation. In amazement he watched the latter as he
strode up and down the length of the great room, lost
apparently in the deepest thought. But his amazement
grew to stupefaction when <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> went on to say:</p>

<p>“What, can a prisoner contrive to leave your prison
of an evening and return again before daylight?”</p>

<p>The question was, indeed, of a sort to rouse <span lang="fr">M. Chaigniste’s</span>
indignation. He, the model administrator, he who
since first he came to the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite> had never had an “affair”;
he, who was so proud of his staff that he looked upon
himself as the father of his subordinates; he, who, only
yesterday, had written a masterly report declaring in good
set terms that everything was for the best in this best of
<a id="png.215" href="#png.215"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>215<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>all possible prisons; <em>he</em> was suspected of having allowed
prisoners the possibility of taking their walks abroad in
the night! “His” prison, it seemed, was a hotel which
people might quit at will, to go about their private affairs
and come back again when they had enjoyed their liberty
long enough!</p>

<p>He was on the point of returning <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> a cutting
and dignified answer when the latter, guessing his thoughts,
broke in:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur Chaigniste</span>, I feel convinced all duties are
performed to perfection in your establishment. But still,
answer me this question: Does <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> cell contain any
implement capable of making the wound you have noted?”</p>

<p>The Governor was nonplussed; shaking his head emphatically,
he declared:</p>

<p>“I can confidently say no! There are numbers of
prisoners who, when they are locked up, try to make away
with themselves, so not only do we search everyone, but
every article that might be dangerous is removed and the
cells hold no single thing that could cause a wound, even
the most trifling.”</p>

<p>“Then,” <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> went on, “if <span lang="fr">Juve</span> did not hurt
himself in his cell, he must have left his cell. You see
that, surely! Now listen, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Chaigniste</span>, I came
here this morning to inquire into <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> condition. But
long before your warder opened the prisoner’s cell door
and saw his bleeding arm, <em>I</em> knew that <span lang="fr">Juve</span> must be
wounded, and all I came for was to have my suspicions
corroborated. A horrible crime was committed last night;
its author was wounded in the arm; I suspected <span lang="fr">Juve</span>,
and <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is wounded in the arm! Then, I say, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> did
that crime! <span lang="fr">Juve</span> escaped from your prison last night,
committed a cowardly murder in the middle of a ball,
killing one of my inspectors, who no doubt had managed
to penetrate his disguise; then he came back and voluntarily
put himself under lock and key, in order to provide
himself an <span class="prellips">alibi </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“Horrible! horrible!” stammered the Governor, quite
overcome.</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>it</em> is horrible, but the culprit shall pay dear for
his misdeeds, for we have him now safe and sure!”</p>

<p>“Horrible!” again groaned <span lang="fr">M. Chaigniste</span>.</p>

<p><a id="png.216" href="#png.216"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>216<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Yes, <span class="prellips">indeed </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and yet there’s something strikes me
as strange about the business and makes me hesitate.
Let us reason it out calmly and quietly. There is one
quality we cannot deny <span lang="fr">Juve</span> possesses, and that is intelligence.
He must have felt pretty sure the murderer’s
wounded arm had been noticed at the grand duchess’s;
he must have seen that it would be proof positive, irrefragable
proof of his crime. He was not pursued, he had time
enough to leave Paris and gain the frontier. That, to my
eyes, constitutes a problem it is necessary to solve in order
to hold the key to the mystery, and it seems to me difficult
to solve it except in favour of my old subordinate.”</p>

<p>Little by little, <span lang="fr">M. Chaigniste</span> had succeeded in gathering
his wits together and reducing his thoughts to some sort of
order after all the successive shocks he had undergone in
so short a space of time. He now recalled the startling
confidence <span lang="fr">Dr. Du Marvier</span> had whispered in his ear
and felt it was incumbent in him to share his knowledge
with <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>.</p>

<p>“I am going to tell you one thing,” he began, after
some hesitation, “a thing that will possibly help you to
clear up this mystery. <span lang="fr">Dr. Du Marvier</span>, after examining
<span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> wound, noticed that the prisoner looked pale and
appeared greatly exhausted; he questioned him, listened to
his heart, and observed that its action was considerably
retarded. By what he told me in confidence, all this would
seem to point to his having been poisoned, very probably
with hydrate of chloral. But that is, after all, only a
hypothesis, and besides, I don’t quite see how one could
establish a connection between this kind of poisoning and
the wound we are talking about.”</p>

<p>But at the words, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> sprang up from the chair
in which he had at last seated himself.</p>

<p>“What!” he cried, “you don’t see the connection?
Why, don’t you know that chloral is not only a poison, but
also a soporific? <span lang="fr">Juve</span> would seem to have taken a
soporific? But why? With what object? Not only does
this not throw light on the mystery, but it makes it still more
<span class="prellips">obscure </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span lang="fr">Monsieur Chaigniste</span>, are you sure your staff
are to be trusted?”</p>

<p>The Governor threw up his head like a man deeply
offended, and replied in a grave voice:</p>

<p><a id="png.217" href="#png.217"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>217<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I can answer for them as surely as I can for myself.
I have carefully studied the characters of all my warders,
and I can assure you there is not a single one of them on
whom the fullest and most implicit reliance may not be
placed.”</p>

<p>“And since <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> incarceration there have been no
changes? Which is the warder specially in charge of him?”</p>

<p>“A man called <span lang="fr">Hervé</span>, a man employed here ten years
or more, and of whose conduct I have never had any but
excellent reports.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, I have one favour left to ask you, to be
authorized to visit the prisoner in his cell; after that I
need only thank you for the information you have been so
good as to give me this morning.”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">The Governor was hardly out of the Infirmary before
<span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> wound was summarily attended to, and he was
then handed over to the warders’ tender mercies. Not
without the accompaniment of some hearty cuffs, the strait-waistcoat
was put on and the prisoner was taken back to his
cell. <span lang="fr">Juve</span> made no protest, the same state of weakness
and prostration still continued and reduced him to a condition
of unresisting and silent passivity. It was only by
degrees that he recovered his self-composure and could
look the new situation in which he found himself in the
face. His first impulse was to give way to the utter abandonment
of despair. Alas! even in prison he was not
secure from his adversary’s machinations! He had thought
that, after thus depriving him of all power to act, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
would be satisfied with the freedom so secured him to pursue
at his ease the series of his crimes, and would forget the
existence of his foe.</p>

<p>But lo! he now found himself once more the prey of
his savage adversary! For <span lang="fr">Juve</span> felt no doubt the wound
in his arm, the distress that tormented his whole body,
were <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> work. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had accomplices inside
the prison, and it was these confederates who had come at
night to make a cut on his arm as if he had been wounded,
after first sending him to sleep by means of the drug the
debilitating effects of which he still experienced. With
what object had they so acted? He did not know and he
could not guess, ponder the matter as he might. But at
<a id="png.218" href="#png.218"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>218<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>least the fact was certain, undeniable, and it put the crown
on his calamity! <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had accomplices in his prison!
The thought never ceased tormenting the unhappy man
with ever increasing intensity, when suddenly a new idea
struck him that made him spring up joyfully from his
chair and stride up and down his narrow cell.</p>

<p>“If <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> has accomplices in the prison, I am bound
to know them, these same accomplices, they must come
in contact with me every day,” thought <span lang="fr">Juve</span>: “but if
I know them, it will be possible for me to detect them
and confound their plans. What was the saddest feature
of my position was that I was powerless, and could expect
the discovery of the truth only from the efforts of others.
Now I am going to work for myself, and deep as the mystery
may be, I shall clear it up, just because I am so
resolved to do so.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> was at this point in his reflections when <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>
entered his cell. At sight of his old Chief the prisoner
made a movement of recoil. The Head of the Criminal
Bureau pretended not to see this and took a seat on a
stool; then he signed to the two warders, who since morning
had been permanently stationed in the cell, to withdraw,
and when they had shut the door behind them, he
began in these terms:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span>, since this morning, a grave suspicion rests upon
you; the wound you have on your arm is a very damning
proof of your guilt.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> was persuaded that <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> was the prime
mover in his ruin, so that the friendship and devotion he
bore his Chief previously to his imprisonment had been
succeeded by something of rancour.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he replied, “you think you have been clever
enough already to discover many indications of my guilt;
I make no doubt you will be ingenious enough to discover
many more. What I am afraid of is that you are not
clever enough ever to find the proofs of my innocence.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span>, you are in error in supposing I nourish any fixed
prejudice against you. You know in what esteem I have
held you and what friendship I have felt for you? I have
deplored more than anybody the combination of circumstances
that led to your arrest, and ever since then I have
conducted my investigation loyally and without
<a id="png.219" href="#png.219"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>219<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>preconceptions. It is highly important in your own interest to
answer frankly the questions I am going to ask you about
your wound and your illness in the <span class="prellips">night </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span class="prellips">now </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>It was plain from the tone of studied moderation exhibited
by <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> that the Head of the Criminal
Bureau desired but one thing, to throw some light on the
mystery that so distressed them both, and that the information
<span lang="fr">M. Chaigniste</span> had given him with regard to the prisoner’s
having swallowed a strong dose of hydrate of chloral
had very considerably shaken the conviction he at first
professed as to <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> culpability. It followed that the way
he put the questions he had indicated was such as little by
little to bring about in the prisoner’s breast a return to
feelings of trust and friendliness. Without making any
definite confidences to his former Chief, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> gave the
latter a glimpse of the hopes he entertained of succeeding
by way of the inside of the prison in unveiling a corner
of the mystery.</p>

<p>The conversation was a long and evidently a satisfactory
one, for on parting, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> extended his hand cordially
to his erstwhile fellow worker, while <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> face beamed
with glad relief, and reawakened hope.</p>

 ><small>A WOMAN’S SELF-SACRIFICE</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">The</span> ferry-boat that plies between the bank of the lake
and the <span lang="fr">Ile de Beauté</span> on which the <span lang="fr">Restaurant Azaïs</span>
stands had not actually touched the landing-stage before
<span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, standing up on one of the thwarts of the boat,
in which indeed he was the only passenger, leapt ashore,
in a paroxysm of nervous excitement.</p>

<p>“What am I going to find here?” thought the Chief of
the Criminal Bureau, “what fresh difficulties am I to be
faced with, agitated as I am, and really not knowing what
to do? Then how simply grotesque the visit I paid along
with the Minister of Justice to that impossible person
Tom Bob—grotesque to the uttermost degree! I arrive
with a companion who is to be incognito; before I have
been there three minutes the man addresses him by his
name! I come to charge him with crimes committed at
the Grand Duchess Alexandra’s house; he has never set
foot inside the place! Then, to crown all, he is rung up by
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, offering him contemptuously a petty piece of
revenge—by way of annoying the Department! Then
presently, when we reach the prison, it is to find <span lang="fr">Juve</span>
wounded and declaring he knows no more about it than
we do!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, so formal and precise a man, so staid and
deliberate as a rule, was for the moment so enraged he
entirely forgot his dignity and dashed helter skelter, running
like a schoolboy, across the little terrace separating
the <span lang="fr">Restaurant Azaïs</span> from the lakeside. There were only
a few diners that evening occupying the tables, and already
the majority were hurrying for the ferry-boat, that
was making ready, after landing the Chief on the island,
to re-cross to the mainland. Only one man remained
seated at a table at the farthest end of the restaurant,
<a id="png.221" href="#png.221"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>221<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>where he was finishing his meal. <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> recognized
this solitary diner at once and ran up to him.</p>

<p>“Well?” he panted.</p>

<p>Tom Bob lifted his head and recognized the newcomer.
Speaking in his quietest tones: “Oh! so there you are, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>?” he observed.</p>

<p>“<span class="prellips">Yes </span><span class="ellips">...</span> well?” again asked the Chief.</p>

<p>“Take a chair, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>; you’ll help me drink
my coffee? No?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> was boiling over. “The devil take your
coffee!” he shouted. “Have you seen anything?”</p>

<p>Still quite unmoved, Tom Bob shrugged.</p>

<p>“I have seen,” he said, “that the cooking here is quite
decently good and that it’s an excellent place for eating a
quiet dinner.”</p>

<p>“Devil take you and your dinner! Come now, answer
me <span class="prellips">seriously </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> has not come yet.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> heaved a sigh of relief, and at last allowed
himself to sink into the chair Tom Bob had pushed forward
for him.</p>

<p>“Not come yet!” he exclaimed, “ah, well, I’m rather
relieved after all. It was just a joker then?”</p>

<p>“A joker! Whom d’you mean?”</p>

<p>“Egad, why, the man who ’phoned you!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Still—as nothing has happened.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob called the waiter. “Bring the cigars,” he
ordered. Then, turning again to the Head of the Criminal
Bureau:</p>

<p>“Well, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>,” he said, “if nothing has
happened, I fancy that’s because the time hasn’t come
yet for anything to happen, that’s all.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> growled out: “You think <span class="prellips">the </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“I <span class="prellips">think </span><span class="ellips">...</span> ’pon my word! <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>, I think
the wisest thing to do is to wait patiently. Anyway, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
strikes me as being quite a man of the world. If
he really means to destroy the charming surroundings
where he has brought me for this little dinner, I think he
has had the politeness to wait till I have finished. It was
the least he could do.”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> failed to appreciate the American
<a id="png.222" href="#png.222"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>222<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>detective’s irony. Interrupting him in the middle of his
sentence, he sprang from his chair, and slapping his
forehead:</p>

<p>“And my men?” he cried, “I must make sure they are
there.”</p>

<p>“What men?”</p>

<p>“The officers.”</p>

<p>“You’ve sent police-officers here?”</p>

<p>“Ten inspectors from the Bureau, yes!”</p>

<p>An amused smile flitted over the detective’s lips as he
looked at <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> whimsically.</p>

<p>“By the Lord!” he cried, “if I was <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, I should
be flattered; at a telephone ring from him, you set a little
army in motion, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>! It’s a pretty compliment,
d’you know, on your part.”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> would hear no more.</p>

<p>“It’s a compliment, or it’s not a compliment,” he struck
in in a dry tone that, he hoped, would cut short the American’s
irony. “<!-- TN: opening quote invisible -->Anyhow, this is the way it is; you, if by
any chance you succeeded in catching one glimpse of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
they’d all be shouting <em>wonderful! miraculous!</em> If I
were to arrest him, why, they’d just say it was all in
the day’s work; now, as I don’t arrest him, they throw
stones at me<span class="ellips">!...</span> Meet you again, directly, I’m off to see
if my men are posted.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> took three steps to go, then thinking better
of it and coming up to Tom Bob again:</p>

<p>“Look here,” he excused himself, “I was a bit blunt
with you; but you mustn’t be angry, for some while back
I’ve had good cause to be irritable, you’ll admit that?”</p>

<p>“I do,” Tom Bob agreed.</p>

<p>“Then forgive me! Now tell me—you’ve done some
smart things since your arrival in this country, I can’t
deny you’re clever—tell me, have you any idea what
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> may try to do this evening?”</p>

<p>Tom Bob was evidently too good-hearted and too nice
a fellow not to commiserate the bad temper <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>
suffered from, for it was in a very cordial tone this time
that he answered the Chief of the Criminal Bureau:</p>

<p>“I can form no supposition on that point—nay, I will
go further, and admit there’s something that worries
<span class="prellips">me </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><a id="png.223" href="#png.223"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>223<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“This; if <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> has invited us here, it is because
he is quite confident we are not likely either to guess or
parry the blow he is preparing. Moreover, I’ve been
engaged since I got here, in making a cursory investigation,
and having learnt <span class="prellips">nothing </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, to the last degree perplexed, had become
deeply buried in his own thoughts.</p>

<p>“For my own part,” he admitted, “do you know what
it is worries me?”</p>

<p>“No! What does?”</p>

<p>“I keep asking myself whether <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> has not enticed
us here, has not enticed you here in particular, you, Tom
Bob, on purpose to have a free hand at some other spot in
the city which it was his pleasure perhaps to visit.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob too, debated the supposition <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> had
just formulated.</p>

<p>“No, that would not be playing fair,” he said at last;
“and <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> has never been dishonourable. No, I can’t
believe he would do that.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> shrugged his shoulders by way of answer;
he distrusted the American’s psychological acumen.</p>

<p>After a short silence, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> resumed:</p>

<p>“Well, as you please, Monsieur Bob, but my opinion is
that for to-night, either we are the victims of some practical
joker, or in any case the affair is off. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> must
have seen that my officers were here in force. For my
part, I am going to take a turn to look after my men; I
know where they are, hidden about the island. Then I
shall take the ferry again and so back to the Prefecture.
Will you join me?”</p>

<p>Tom Bob shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he declared, “I shall spend the night here. I
make it a point to keep my tryst with <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. However,
<span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, I will go with you in the boat as far as
the other bank; that will give me the pleasure of another
row on this pretty lake, a perfect jewel at this time of an
evening, the finest thing of its kind, surely, in Paris.”</p>

<p>Still in a hurry, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> did not stop to listen to the
American’s praises of the <span lang="fr">Bois de Boulogne</span>. He crossed
the little wooden bridge joining the two parts of the island,
made sure that the officers he had sent there in the afternoon
<a id="png.224" href="#png.224"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>224<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were at their posts, ordered them to keep a most
careful watch all night on the lake and its approaches, then
made his way back to Tom Bob.</p>

<p>“You are coming?”</p>

<p>“I am quite ready.”</p>

<p>The detective got up, paid the bill for his dinner, and
took another cigar, while <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, faithful to his usual
habits, refused the Havana Tom Bob offered him and drew
a cigarette from his case. The two police-officials left the
restaurant and made for the landing, where the ferry-boat
was again putting in.</p>

<p>“Get in,” <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> urged the American.</p>

<p>“After you!” protested the Head of the Criminal Bureau.
“Halloa, have you a light about you? Will you pass me
a match, I haven’t got one.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob looked at his cigar. “I’m not well alight
myself,” he said, and pulling a box of vestas from his
pocket, he lit one, handed it to <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, then took it
back and applied it to his own cigar; then, as the match
was beginning to burn his fingers, he tossed it into the
lake.</p>

<p>But then, suddenly, with terrifying intensity, with an
incredible rapidity, a fantastic, unheard-of, appalling thing
happened. The very instant the burning match touched the
water, the lake caught fire and blazed up fiercely, giving
off dense clouds of smoke and sending up huge flickering
flames of red and blue that instantly covered the whole
surface with a sheet of fire.</p>

<p>Fortunately Tom Bob had managed to grip <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>
by the arm and drag him back from the boat he was just
getting into, and both started running breathlessly for the
middle of the island, accompanied as they went by the
various <span lang="fr">employés</span> of the <cite lang="fr">Azaïs</cite>, the manager and a few
customers who were still on the premises, all flying headlong
before the flames. The sight was fairylike, unforgettable<!-- TN: original reads "unforget-able" -->,
but tragic to the last degree. The whole lake indeed
was a veritable sea of fire, which the eye could not pierce.
From this gigantic brazier a sooty smoke went up in swirling
eddies, instantly veiling the sky with thick, heavy
clouds. The heat was terrific, so intense that the sweat
rolled in torrents down the faces of the unfortunates imprisoned
on the island. The air indeed was almost
<a id="png.225" href="#png.225"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>225<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>unbreathable. All round the party branches kept breaking off the
trees and the smaller boughs<!-- TN: original reads "boughts" --> beginning to flare up, while the
shrubs dipping in the water were in turn taking fire.</p>

<p>“We are done for!” groaned <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>. But Tom Bob
preserved his presence of mind.</p>

<p>“To the middle of the island!” he shouted; “come this
way,”—and he led all his companions to the centre of the
little island. Once there, he proceeded to calm their apprehensions.</p>

<p>“Keep cool!” he said, “keep cool! If the lake is on fire,
there can be only one explanation, that they’ve emptied over
the surface barrels of naphtha or petroleum. Egad! <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
can’t be far; it’s a miracle we have escaped, <span lang="fr">Monsieur
Havard</span>; I imagine he was only waiting for both of
us to be in the boat between the bank and the island to put
a light to his naphtha and roast us to death.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> agreed, “a minute more and
we were dead men.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob shook his head gravely. “If only there are no
fatalities,” he said. “Look, it strikes me the flames are
not so fierce now? Evidently the layer of naphtha cannot
have been very thick. Yes, the flames are dropping,
<span class="prellips">but </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span class="prellips">but </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”—as he spoke, fearful screams broke out
coming from a little further away. <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> and the
detective looked at each other in consternation. The cries
grew louder and louder, and with one impulse the two men
dashed to the rescue. They had distinctly heard the words:</p>

<p>“Help! help<span class="ellips">!...</span> <span lang="fr">Fantômas! Fantômas! Fantômas</span> is
here!”</p>

<p>While <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> and the unlucky Tom Bob were in
such imminent peril from the monstrous audacity of the
ever elusive brigand, while the lake was taking fire with
alarming rapidity, a tragedy had been enacting on its banks.</p>

<p>It was the day after the Grand Duchess Alexandra’s
ball, and that very evening Lady Beltham, in fulfilment of
her promise to <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, was to go and see <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>
to assure her of the journalist’s innocence. <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> never
doubted that the great lady would keep her engagement
and find some way of meeting the girl. After the furious
dagger thrust, against which his coat of mail had so fortunately
protected him, after his flight from the grand duchess’s,
a flight that lady had in fact facilitated, the journalist
<a id="png.226" href="#png.226"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>226<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>could no longer doubt that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had been really present
at that festivity. And from that moment the death of the
unfortunate police-officer was no riddle to him—<span lang="fr">Joffre</span> had
fallen by the hand of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. This fresh murder in no
way surprised him.</p>

<p>Accordingly <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, anxious above all things to
meet <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> and secure a renewal of the girl’s
favour, had all the afternoon been watching for Lady Beltham’s
arrival at the lake in the <span lang="fr">Bois</span>. But it was only at
nine in the evening that she arrived, and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had of
course taken care not to reveal his presence just then.
When Lady Beltham should be returning and re-crossing
the lake, then he would go to her and thank her and ask
her if he might now go to <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> to find her convinced of
his innocence; for the moment it was very necessary to keep
concealed.</p>

<p>But just as the boat reached the landing place of the
<span lang="fr">Restaurant Azaïs, Fandor</span>, who was still prowling on the
road beside the lake, caught sight of <span lang="fr">M. Havard’s</span> figure,
and Tom Bob with him, both evidently intending to take
the ferry on their way back to Paris.</p>

<p>Then in an instant came a flash, a blaze, an impassable
wall of fire separating the journalist from the island and
the restaurant. Like a madman, the unhappy man ran
along the bank, wringing his hands in despair. But what
could he do? what could he do? In an agony he pictured
the terrible position, perhaps the fatal <span class="prellips">position </span><span class="ellips">...</span> in
which the wretches now on the island might find themselves.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>!” he cried, “<span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>, oh! we are under a
curse!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> in fact was asking himself if the fire was not
going to reach the island, if indeed the island itself, drenched
with petroleum, was not blazing too; if <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> were not
doomed to die by that awful death, the death that is worse
than a thousand deaths, death by fire!</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> could divine the whole villainous plot. No, it
was no mere coincidence that the lake should take fire at
the very moment <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> learned that he was innocent.
Not a doubt of it this was another of the horrid acts of
cruelty <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> loved. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had willed <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>
should die at that precise moment. Yes, for he knew all,
he had learned the <i lang="fr">rendez-vous</i> arranged with the grand
<a id="png.227" href="#png.227"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>227<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>duchess, for had he not been present at the whole conversation
between <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> and the great lady, when <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> merely
supposed he was looking at one of the many reflections
in the mirrors ornamenting the walls of the winter garden.</p>

<p>The lake had been burning for nearly three minutes.
Suddenly <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> made up his mind; throwing off his coat,
the brave young man ran to the bank of the lake, whose
waters were still blazing; his face was pale, but a look of
determination flashed in his eyes as he plunged into the
torrent of fire!</p>

<p>“I will swim under water,” the daring fellow told himself.
“No, I cannot let <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> perish so; if she is to die,
I will die near her, with her!”</p>

<p>It was a heroic but a mad venture. The channel separating
the mainland from the island was broad, and half
way across, he had no breath left and must at any cost
come to the surface, magnificent swimmer though he was.
The water was still blazing. Barely had he time to
snatch a mouthful of mephitic, scarce breathable air, when
he must dive under again on pain of being burnt alive.</p>

<p>“Ten strokes more<span class="ellips">!...</span> five <span class="prellips">more </span><span class="ellips">...</span> three more!”—his
knees grazed the bottom, he had reached the shore!</p>

<p>Panting, breathless, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> climbed on the bank, grievously
hurt, bleeding, half dead; but he was near his goal.
He cried, “<span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>!”—and in the distance, his eyes still
dazzled with the glare of the fire, the journalist seemed to
see a woman’s form. He staggered towards her, a haggard,
terrifying figure. But no sooner was he near the girl, for
it was really she, flying with Lady Beltham before the
advancing flames—she had taken refuge there—than he
started back, struck with consternation.</p>

<p>Lady Beltham had not yet had time to speak to <span lang="fr">Elisabeth
Dollon</span>, and the girl, seeing this dreadful apparition rise
before her, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, pale and bleeding, had screamed out
in frantic terror:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas! Fantômas!</span> it is <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>“Where is he gone!” Lady Beltham eagerly questioned
<span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> and Tom Bob, who had run up on hearing the
cries. She had not recognized <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, but on the other
hand she knew it was not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> who had shown himself.
Instinctively she pointed in the direction in which the
journalist had taken to flight.</p>

<p><a id="png.228" href="#png.228"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>228<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Thereupon followed a veritable man-hunt, duly organized.
Blowing a shrill whistle, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> called up his
men, scattered more or less everywhere about the island.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is there” he yelled, “he has just swum over<span class="ellips">....</span>
Dead or alive he must be taken, dead or alive!”</p>

<p>Not a clump of trees but was searched. The waters of
the lake, no longer aflame, looked dark and gloomy as
before, clouds of soot made the air oppressive to breathe,
the only light to help the officers in their frantic search came
from some trees that were still burning on the bank of the
lake. From all sides sounded cries, shouts, exclamations.
For <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was now in full flight before the pursuing
myrmidons of the law.</p>

<p>What did it all mean? He was far from having any
clear conception of this. Once more <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had laid
his plans marvellously well; once more Fortune had favoured
him. He it was, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> could surely guess, who had contrived
that Tom Bob and <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> were on the island
at the very moment the lake was to burst into flame. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
had of course felt no doubt that <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, prowling
about the neighbourhood waiting to know the result of
Lady Beltham’s visit, would be one of the first to make a
dash for the island. In this way he would tumble into a
regular trap.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was in full flight, seeing everywhere men hunting
for him, revolver in hand, for the scattered conflagrations,
dying down one by one, still afforded some light.</p>

<p>“By the Lord!” he thought to himself, “I have no choice.
I must take to the water, stay as long as possible out in
the middle of the lake; it’ll be the devil’s own luck if I
don’t manage to put them off the scent.” But at that
moment a ball whistled past his ear. He had imprudently
come too close, an officer had caught sight of him and fired.</p>

<p>“Damnation!” muttered the young man, springing back
sharply, “it seems a price is set on my head.”</p>

<p>“There! there, I tell you! God Almighty, give me a
revolver!” The pursuit was still hot, when suddenly a
splash was heard in the water. The police officers gathered
in a crowd; “He’ll get away! and never a boat!”</p>

<p>But one of the men was equal to the occasion; “‘Dead
or alive!’ <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> told us we were to capture <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
dead or alive! By God! it was childish to spare his life
<a id="png.229" href="#png.229"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>229<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>when we had him at our mercy. A volley!” cried the man,
“Fire, all together!”</p>

<p>His advice was followed, the officers fired off their revolvers
at a venture in the direction of the splash. And next
instant, drowning the sound of the shots, a sharp cry rang
through the night:</p>

<p>“Help<span class="ellips">!...</span> oh<span class="ellips">!...</span> help!”</p>

<p>“Hit! <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is hit!”</p>

<p>But Tom Bob was already making for the restaurant
at a run. A boat lay high and dry on the bank; swiftly
he dragged it to the water’s edge, sprang in, and in a few
strokes of the oars was at the spot the cries had come from.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>” he yelled—he could be clearly heard from
the shore—“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! surrender!”</p>

<p>Other boats came up; each second seemed an eternity.
But now <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, leaning over the side of his boat,
gripped a dark shape struggling in the water; “I’ve got
him!” Then in triumph, he shouted an order to the officer
who was at the oars:</p>

<p>“Row, my man, bring us to the shore<span class="ellips">!...</span> there, beside
that tree, it is still burning, so we shall see plain, anyhow<span class="ellips">!...</span>
he must be seriously wounded, he has stopped
struggling.”</p>

<p>But as the boat entered the zone illuminated by the
blazing tree, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, still holding the mysterious human
body he had gripped in the darkness, could not check an
exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p>“Oh! curses on it! curses on it! It is not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!
It is not the man! it is a woman!”</p>

<p>Others helped, and the inert form was soon carried ashore.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, Lady Beltham, who had looked on in
frenzied distress at all this scene of horror, came forward,
a tragic figure, her eyes wide with terror.</p>

<p>“Oh! it is horrible,” she groaned, falling on her knees
beside the half-drowned woman’s body, “it is horrible, she
tried to save him, to put them off the scent! They have
killed an innocent woman! they have killed <span lang="fr">Elisabeth
Dollon</span>!”</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smc">You</span> are good and kind, madam.”</p>

<p>“No, no! don’t say that.”</p>

<p>“But you are! you are exquisitely good, exquisitely kind.”</p>

<p>A spasm of pain crossed the Grand Duchess Alexandra’s
face, and it was in almost a harsh tone that she protested
again:</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. Then, to begin with, the doctor
forbids you to talk; you must obey his orders so as to get
well, and you know very well you have to get well quickly.”</p>

<p>Moving soundlessly over the thick carpets of the sick-room,
the grand duchess stepped up to the bed on which
lay the young girl she addressed. With a light, skilful
touch she shook up the pillows, re-arranged the bedclothes
and settled the patient in the most comfortable position.</p>

<p>“Try to get to sleep, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I am not sleepy; I am burning with fever and I feel
thirsty—oh! so thirsty.”</p>

<p>The grand duchess carefully measured out a few drops of
champagne into a glass, added a little water, and held
out the cool, refreshing beverage:</p>

<p>“Drink, my poor darling. The doctor did not forbid
this.”</p>

<p>A wan smile hovered on the patient’s lips, as she eagerly
quenched her raging thirst.</p>

<p>“The doctor!” she murmured, “why does the doctor worry
me with his prescriptions? He knows I shall not get well.”</p>

<p>But in a severe voice now, a tinge of bitterness even in
its tones, the grand duchess replied:</p>

<p>“I do not wish you, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>, to talk like that. You
have no right not to get well<span class="ellips">....</span> Think of him!”</p>

<p>By what series of strange events came <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>,
for the injured woman was indeed <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>, to
<a id="png.231" href="#png.231"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>231<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be in this house, the house of the Grand Duchess Alexandra,
to have that enigmatic personage for sick-nurse?</p>

<p>The pursuit of <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> among the underwood of the <span lang="fr">Ile
de Beauté</span>, while the blazing lake was burning itself out, had
ended in a startling tragedy, the discovery of <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>
wounded, shot by the police-officers, who had fired on her
in the belief they were shooting at <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. How had the
mistake come about? Alas! it found its explanation in a
terrible scene that had just passed between the Grand
Duchess Alexandra and the unhappy girl the young journalist
loved. When the first moments of stupefaction were
over, and the officers of justice were hotly pursuing the
fugitive, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> had confessed to the grand
duchess in the stammering accents of terror, that it was
really and truly the journalist <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> she had seen and
denounced under the name of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.</p>

<p>Then the grand duchess had hesitated no more. She had
come there to undeceive <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>, to convince her
of <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> innocence, and now she carried out her intention
with a vigour and emphasis born of her sympathy
with the pair, and even as she spoke, she could see the girl
turn pale and almost faint in her excitement. It was true
then, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was innocent? <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was worthy of her
love! <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was the victim of a cruel Fate!—and it
was she who had set the policemen on his track, the men
who at that moment were ransacking the island to seize
him, dead or alive!</p>

<p>In an instant the brave girl had resolved on a sublime
act of self-sacrifice. Realizing that <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was done for
if the pursuit continued, she made up her mind to interrupt
this dreadful man-hunt. But how? By a terrible, a
tragic ruse. In the darkness she ran to the water-side, threw
herself into the lake, where she swam about vigorously,
splashing with might and main so as to attract attention.</p>

<p>The hoped for result followed. The men heard the noise,
they thought it was their quarry escaping, confusion grew
worse confounded.</p>

<p>All this she had expected; but, alas! one grim consequence
of her act she had not foreseen. In the fierce
eagerness of their pursuit, the officers did not rest content
merely to dash off on the fugitive’s traces; fully believing it
was <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> trying to escape, they fired off their revolvers,
<a id="png.232" href="#png.232"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>232<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hardly stopping to take aim. A ball struck <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>, she
gave one despairing shriek, and it was a wounded, half-drowned
woman <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> brought ashore.</p>

<p>All crowded round the unfortunate girl, who still lay
unconscious, and presently she was carried to the restaurant,
where the Grand Duchess Alexandra was the first to kneel
beside her, exhausting every means to recall her to life.
She alone had seen all, and had guessed the true explanation
of the terrible adventure. Her own love story a tragedy,
herself a heroine in her day, the grand duchess could not
fail to understand the motives that had guided <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>,
while the young girl’s noble self-sacrifice, her marvellous
courage, had won the great lady’s highest respect and admiration.</p>

<p>Waiting till the police had completed their inquiries, the
grand duchess herself organized the transport of the injured
woman. She was determined to take her home with
her and had her carried to her house in the <span lang="fr">Parc des Princes</span>;
there she summoned to her bedside the highest medical
talent to be found in Paris. Doubtless she hoped by thus
devoting herself to <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span>, by soothing away so
far as was possible the girl’s dreadful anxieties, to repair,
as much as in her lay, the cruelties of her lover, of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
the man she loved in spite of everything.</p>

<p>Two days had passed, and during that time <span lang="fr">Elisabeth
Dollon’s</span> condition, far from improving, had actually grown
worse. The surgeons, called in one after the other, had
departed, shaking their heads ominously; the ball had
struck <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> full in the chest and grazed the lungs.
“She may be saved; it is possible she may recover!” such
had been Professor Ardell’s<!-- TN: original reads "Ardel's" --> pronouncement. He had prescribed
absolute quiet, rest, a light diet, but alas! had not
concealed the serious apprehensions he felt for the patient’s
life.</p>

<p>It was in a feeble, breathless, almost inaudible voice,
that <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> appealed to the Grand Duchess Alexandra.</p>

<p>“You have had no news of him yet?” she asked.</p>

<p>The grand duchess, seeing the girl was awake, had
drawn up a chair to the bedside and was holding between
her slim, aristocratic fingers, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth’s</span> little hands.</p>

<p>“No, I have no tidings of him yet. But, as I told you,
he has escaped. No doubt he finds it difficult to come
<a id="png.233" href="#png.233"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>233<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>here, my house is perhaps watched. How can we tell?
But do not agitate yourself, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span>; I repeat, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> is
bound to find out that you are here, and knowing you are
here, he also knows that I must have convinced you of his
innocence. I am persuaded he will not be long before he
comes to see you<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>But suddenly the grand duchess broke off. Framed in
the doorway the figure of a man had appeared; his face
was worn with suffering, and he had pushed his way in
frantic haste to the bedchamber, throwing aside the footman
who was for showing him into an adjoining sitting
room. It was <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>! The unhappy young man
strode across the room and fell to his knees beside <span lang="fr">Elisabeth’s</span>
bed. With a passionate, yet restrained ardour he
took the girl’s hand and covered it with burning kisses.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Elisabeth! Elisabeth!</span>” he murmured, “oh! what misery,
and yet what bliss! to find you here, wounded, wounded for
me! For I understand your noble self-sacrifice. What
happiness to find you again, to have the right to love you!”</p>

<p>At sight of him, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> had instinctively sprung up
in bed as if to rise and meet him; then, exhausted by the
effort, pale as a dead woman, she had sunk back on the
pillows. The hand <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> held lay cold and lifeless in his,
and it was in a weak whisper the girl asked:</p>

<p>“You forgive me, dear, for my suspicions, my distrust
of you?”</p>

<p>The tears stood in <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> eyes as he asked:</p>

<p>“But you do not distrust me any more?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> answered with a wan smile, and the young
man sprang up impulsively and with outstretched hands,
approached the grand duchess.</p>

<p>“Madam!” he cried, “never, madam, can I forget that it
is thanks to <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>No less moved herself, the grand duchess returned <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span>
hand clasp.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she began, “when, in the name of love, you came
to beseech me, me, Lady <span class="prellips">Beltham </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>But there she stopped; with a cry, a groan, <span lang="fr">Elisabeth
Dollon</span> had repeated the name, “Lady Beltham?”</p>

<p>Without intending it, the grand duchess had revealed
to <span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> her real title, her tragic identity. Be sure,
<span lang="fr">Elisabeth</span> had heard of <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> ill-omened mistress!
<a id="png.234" href="#png.234"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>234<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Many times had she read the tragic name of Lady Beltham
in the public prints coupled with that of the notorious
brigand. “Lady Beltham!” So it was Lady Beltham,
this Grand Duchess Alexandra, who was nursing her with
such devoted kindness!</p>

<p>But already, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> was on his knees again beside
<span lang="fr">Elisabeth’s</span> bed.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake,” he besought her, “be brave, my darling!
be calm! be courageous!”</p>

<p>Alas! even as he spoke, the young man felt the sick
woman’s hand grow heavier, more deathlike in his. Like
a flower that has borne the buffets of the storm and fades
at the outburst of too fierce a sun, the unhappy child,
after the grievous hours, the tragic, the dreadful times she
had lived through, could not endure the too overpowering
delight she felt at seeing <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> again, and knowing him
innocent, the too overwhelming shock of discovering that
Lady Beltham stood before her!</p>

<p><span lang="fr">“Elisabeth! Elisabeth!” Jérôme Fandor</span> cried in tones
of sudden terror. Oh! how pale she was now, lying there
with closed eyes, her head thrown back on the pillows,
her golden hair dishevelled!</p>

<p>Lady Beltham, like <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, was seized with a sudden
misgiving. The minutes seemed hours in the slow agony of
suspense. At last the girl opened her eyes; she threw
a grateful look at the grand duchess, this mysterious Lady
Beltham, who had taken pity on her; then, with a superhuman
effort, she whispered faintly: “<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>!”</p>

<p>But as she lifted her hand to meet the journalist’s clasp,
a faint sigh breathed from her lips, a sigh so light, so calm,
it was a full minute yet ere <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, ere Lady
Beltham, realized the dreadful truth, the dire calamity,
the fell catastrophe—<span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon</span> was dead!</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">In the darkened chamber <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor’s</span> long-drawn
sobs proclaimed the unfortunate young man’s infinite distress!
Vaguely and indistinctly, as in a dream, the young
man, still on his knees by the dead girl’s bed, draining to
the dregs his grief and despair, had heard a footman come
in a few minutes before, seeking the Grand Duchess Alexandra.
Absorbed in his grief, dazed with suffering, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
had not so much as raised his head. But the death chamber
<a id="png.235" href="#png.235"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>235<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>communicated by double doors, at present wide open,
with an adjoining sitting room, and from this room voices
could be heard.</p>

<p>The grand duchess, mastering her very sincere grief,
had consented to see a visitor, who was now with her.
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, in the automatic way people’s attention
is fixed by external trifles at times of the most poignant emotions,
in the midst of the deepest sorrows, found himself
listening to the conversation.</p>

<p>“Madam,” a voice was saying, a voice <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> recognized
with a startled exclamation to be that of <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>,
“madam, the step I am taking to-day, believe me, is
official; but in any case I think you will be ready to do as
I desire.”</p>

<p>“Speak, sir.”</p>

<p>“You have recently, madam, taken the initiative in organizing
a public subscription with the object of collecting
the sum demanded by <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> as the condition of his
disappearance, and refused him by the Chamber. That
is so, is it not? you admit the fact?”</p>

<p>Haughtily the grand duchess assented.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that is so. I will even add that the money is
beginning to come in.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” resumed <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, “I do not know what
motive prompted <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>The grand duchess did not let the Head of the Criminal
Bureau finish his sentence.</p>

<p>“The motives that prompted me are quite simple,” she
said; “the Chamber has refused to accept <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span>
ultimatum. That brigand, recoiling at nothing, now that
Parliament has refused his demands, is adding crime to
crime, piling atrocity on atrocity. What the Government
declines to approve, it struck me as incumbent on private
initiative to carry out. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> the murderer promises he
will kill no more if he is paid a million francs. What more
natural, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>, than to open a general subscription
to provide this million? to put <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> in a
position to fulfil his undertaking? to induce him to halt in
his sanguinary and deadly career?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> did not answer at once; after some moments
thought, however, he took up the word:</p>

<p>“Natural it may have been, madam, I have no wish to
<a id="png.236" href="#png.236"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>236<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>gauge the morality of the motives that may have led you to
start this subscription; but I am bound to note the consequences
of your action.”</p>

<p>“And they, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>, are?”</p>

<p>“Deplorable, madam, deplorable!”</p>

<p>“But, sir<span class="ellips">!...</span> It is a reign of terror. The vilest abominations
are of daily occurrence; crime follows crime, each
more terrifying than the last, more monstrous, assuming
even the character of crimes against the state. I believe
my subscription will quickly prove a success, that I shall
soon raise the sum of money required, that soon <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
will disappear. That is no deplorable result, is it?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> had one of the little coughing fits he so frequently
suffered from and which commonly served to disguise
his embarrassments.</p>

<p>“What is deplorable,” he said at last, in a peevish tone,
“is the fact that this subscription of yours, madam, makes
my duties a farce, renders the French police ridiculous.
How can we consent to <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> being paid to do us the
favour to leave off murdering? He is an assassin! he
should be arrested, that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>In a tone almost of mockery, certainly of irony, the
grand duchess protested:</p>

<p>“But, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>, you don’t arrest him!”</p>

<p>“No,” confessed the Head of the Bureau, “no, not yet!
But we shall arrest him.”</p>

<p>A silence followed, which Lady Beltham at last broke,
to say:</p>

<p>“So that, according to <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“According to me,” declared <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>—“and again I
tell you this officially—it would be well, <span lang="fr">Madame la Grande
Duchesse</span>, to arrest your subscription. It is, I repeat,
really an insult to my office.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> paused, then proceeded:</p>

<p>“However, you are free to act as you deem fit<span class="ellips">....</span> It
is evident that after <span class="prellips">all </span><span class="ellips">...</span><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis --> In a word, madam, my visit
had another object. I may disapprove of your subscription,
I have no right to misappropriate its funds. The fact is I
have <span class="prellips">received </span><span class="ellips">...</span> from an anonymous contributor a sum
of ten thousand francs with the request to hand it to you;
here is the money.”</p>

<p>All the time the grand duchess and <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> were thus
<a id="png.237" href="#png.237"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>237<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>conversing, <span lang="fr">Jérôme</span> could not help shuddering. He
was barely a few yards from the man who was tracking
him down with such determination! Lady Beltham was
talking to <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> in an adjoining room, but hidden by
the curtains, while he, <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, who was supposed to
be <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> accomplice, with the whole Criminal Bureau
in pursuit of him, was only a few yards away! Was Lady
Beltham going to betray him? She had adored <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
madly, she undoubtedly adored him still; did she not intend,
to help in her lover’s work, to deliver up him, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, to
the Bureau? After all, she knew quite well that <span lang="fr">Jérôme
Fandor</span> was the only man—<span lang="fr">Juve</span> being in gaol—capable of
checkmating the brigand. How she must be tempted to
denounce him to <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>! But no, no! he must, he ought
to trust to her good faith; Lady Beltham was an enemy,
but she was an honourable enemy!</p>

<p>Then <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> weighed the value to be attached to what
<span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> had said. He could well understand the annoyance
the Head of the Criminal Department might reasonably
feel about the subscription opened by Lady Beltham.
But then, what was the meaning of this gift from an
anonymous well-wisher transmitted through <span lang="fr">M. Havard’s</span>
hands? Must one not, in fact, gather that the Head of
the Criminal Bureau, anxious above all measure to be rid
of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, was equally desirous, while concealing his
<i lang="la">modus operandi</i>, to contribute to the fund and so hasten
the time when the grand duchess would have the million
francs in hand and be in a position to secure the brigand’s
disappearance?</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor’s</span> reflections were suddenly interrupted;
he had heard Lady Beltham speaking again:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, you may, as a police-officer, regret the
opening of my subscription, which I can well understand
hurts your professional interests; but as a woman, I
confess I am afraid of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, I shudder at the thought
of the atrocious crimes this brigand is still committing,
and may go on committing. That is why I shall continue
to accept all the sums of money given me with this object.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> in turn replied:</p>

<p>“You are free to act, madam! Still, I hope we shall
have laid hands, not on <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, who, the public is too
apt to forget, is in prison, but on <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, his
<a id="png.238" href="#png.238"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>238<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>redoubtable accomplice, before you have had time to deal
with the funds you are collecting for <span class="prellips">him </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and, <span class="prellips">consequently </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>Lady Beltham did not reply at once, causing <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> a
moment’s suspense that seemed an eternity. He threw
a rapid glance round the room. He was too ill acquainted
with the grand duchess’s mansion to be able to make good
his escape if she told the police-officer he was there. If she
was for betraying him, she could deliver him up without
his having the power to stir a finger to save himself.</p>

<p>But just as the journalist was feeling himself to be caught
in a trap without an issue, he heard Lady Beltham’s voice;
she was saying:</p>

<p>“I wish you every success, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>, in effecting
your arrest of <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>—seeing you believe that
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span> is <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> accomplice.”</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XXII<br
 ><small>A VOLUNTEER WAITER</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Tom Bob</span> had been waiting some while in a small room
reserved for the use of callers on the ground floor of the
house. The detective seemed extremely impatient, again
and again he looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Half after nine,” he muttered, “I cannot afford to waste
time, yet I must make sure Ascott will not fail<span class="ellipsp">....</span>” The
man was frowning in evident anxiety, as he asked himself
what sort of a reception the wealthy Englishman would
accord him. Since the strange affair of the <span lang="fr">Pré Catalan</span>,
which had culminated so extraordinarily in the capsizing
of the automobiles into the lake, Tom Bob had not seen
Ascott again, save on very rare occasions. For this there
were several reasons. In the first place the detective had
been very much taken up—at any rate he said so—with
the events that had occurred since his arrival in Paris, since
he had officially declared his intention to devote himself to
the pursuit and discovery of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. Moreover, the
intrigue between Tom Bob and the Princess Sonia Danidoff
was not, could not be, unknown to the members of the intimate
little group of fellow-travellers that had come together
on board the <cite lang="fr">Lorraine</cite> on her passage across the
Atlantic. Better than anyone, indeed, Ascott, who had
been deeply smitten by the Princess, must be aware that
in Tom Bob he had a fortunate rival, who had quickly won
his lady’s favours. In truth, it required all the American’s
calm effrontery thus, without any preliminary testing of
his footing, to come calling on the young Englishman,
who might very well be proposing to give him a highly unpleasant
reception.</p>

<p>“True it is,” Tom Bob told himself, “that since he abandoned
his unsuccessful wooing of the Princess Sonia, Ascott
has had other amorous adventures that should surely at
this time of day prevent his being jealous of me.” The
<a id="png.240" href="#png.240"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>240<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>affair at the <cite>Silver Goblet</cite> had, in fact, become a matter of
general gossip, albeit not specially spoken about among
the detective’s own circle of friends, and the American
appeared to be perfectly well posted as to what was happening,
as well as what was likely to come of it eventually.</p>

<p>At last Ascott’s man-servant, John, appeared, and invited
the detective to follow him upstairs to his master’s study,
where he found the Englishman seated at his desk, writing.</p>

<p>“Up already!” exclaimed the visitor cheerfully,<!-- TN: comma invisible --> “and ready
for anything! Upon my word, my dear fellow, Paris has
quite changed your habits. How are you this morning?”</p>

<p>Ascott turned half round in his chair, extending a careless
hand to his visitor:</p>

<p>“Not so bad, and you, Tom Bob? To what do I owe
the pleasure of your visit? Take a seat, pray!”</p>

<p>“Good!” thought the detective, “he is not over and above
angry with me!” At the same time, remembering that time
was flying with alarming swiftness, he announced:</p>

<p>“I have merely come to shake you by the hand, as I was
passing your way.”</p>

<p>But Ascott, who appeared to guess the object of his
visit, began to hunt through his pocket-book, from which
he presently extracted a bank note. Holding this out to
the detective:</p>

<p>“Here is my subscription,” he said: “will you be so
obliging as to hand this thousand francs to the Grand
Duchess Alexandra when you have an opportunity of
seeing her.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob expressed his willingness with an almost imperceptible
smile.</p>

<p>“Just fancy, my dear sir,” he remarked, “how timorous
Parisian society is; to think that it is now a perfect mania,
a fashionable craze, quite the correct thing in fact, to
subscribe to this fund. They want to see <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> waxing
fat<span class="ellips">!...</span> ’pon my word! it is excruciatingly funny. Henceforth,
I take it the light-fingered gentry will have an easy
time of it when they want to make their fortunes. Instead
of fagging themselves to commit crimes, they will only
have to make it known through the newspapers that they
are short of cash for the moment, and the money will
come tumbling in straight away! Why, sir,” continued the
detective, “it will be the ruin of the police; I ask you,
<a id="png.241" href="#png.241"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>241<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>what are we to do, my colleagues and I, when there are no
more any culprits to hunt down, any criminals to arrest?”</p>

<p>Tom Bob had uttered his little speech in a tone of
laughing irony well calculated to divert his host, but the
latter declined to be amused.</p>

<p>“What do you think about it?” the detective insisted,
“what impression does all this <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> business make on
you?”</p>

<p>Ascott, rousing himself from a prolonged reverie, shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I don’t care a fig about it,” he declared, “I am bored to
death<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>The other feigned no little surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, that is just what struck me, my dear sir; you
look tired, altered, you never go into society nowadays;
have you had worries perhaps?”</p>

<p>Ascott nodded and was about to speak when the American
broke in, making his question more definite:</p>

<p>“I’ve heard vaguely of some untoward adventure you
were the hero of a while ago<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>“Rather say the victim,” put in Ascott.</p>

<p>The detective caught him up:</p>

<p>“The victim! come, that’s a big word; what <em>did</em> happen
to you?”</p>

<p>The young Englishman seemed unwilling to explain his
words.</p>

<p>“Oh! nothing,” he said, “or nothing much!”</p>

<p>Then, after a pause, and as if he had just come to a
supreme decision, he got up, strode two or three times up
and down the room, then standing before the detective
with folded arms, he declared:</p>

<p>“Tom Bob, I should by rights be more angry with you
than in fact I am, for you have played me a trick, a
damnable trick, involuntarily, I am sure of that, but the
fact remains, you have played me one of those tricks men
find it hard to forgive, you have supplanted me in the affections
of a woman I loved.”</p>

<p>The detective gave a gesture of protestation.</p>

<p>“Pooh! my good sir,” he said, “women and their ways!
these things are never to be taken seriously.”</p>

<p>“That depends; no doubt, you will tell me I had for ages
been courting the princess without winning the smallest
<a id="png.242" href="#png.242"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>242<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>favour from her, while it was enough for you to arrive on
the scene to become instantly the darling of her <span class="prellips">heart </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
well, be it so! I do not press the point, and you may
have noticed this, that I never tried to compete with you.
No, luck or ill luck decreed that at that very moment my
affections took the field elsewhere<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>Tom Bob heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear it, I should have been grieved to
give you pain.”</p>

<p>“Man!” pursued the young man, “you cannot imagine
what happened next.”</p>

<p>Throwing off his indifference more and more, Ascott,
glad of the opportunity<!-- TN: original reads "oportunity" --> to tell his troubles to another,
confided to the detective his extraordinary adventure with
<span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span> and the threats addressed to him; the consequences
of a passing caprice had come to a head.</p>

<p>Tom Bob preserved his calm as he listened to the story.</p>

<p>“And then?” he asked, when Ascott stopped to take
breath.</p>

<p>“Then,” declared the latter, “it is my duty to give you
a piece of news, a great piece of news—I am getting married,
I am marrying <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>!”</p>

<p>“Good luck!” cried the detective, “and when is it to be?”</p>

<p>“This morning, almost directly.”</p>

<p>“Bad luck!” ejaculated Tom Bob—“and I was just
wanting to ask you to breakfast!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on Ascott, with an air of dejection, “in two
hours’ time I shall be the lawful husband of an old usurer’s
niece, <span lang="fr">Père Moche’s</span> niece; oh! it is a fine kettle of fish!”</p>

<p>“Ascott,” put in Tom Bob, trying to console him, “you
are marrying under French law; you know, don’t you?
that divorce is allowed.”</p>

<p>Ascott shrugged his shoulders: “That would make things
no better!”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>The young man assumed a still more despairing look as
he looked in the other’s face and announced:</p>

<p>“My dear Bob, I must tell you all; <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span> is
<i lang="fr">enceinte</i>.”</p>

<p>Ascott looked so crestfallen that, for all his phlegm, Tom
Bob all but burst out laughing. However, he dissembled
his feelings with wonderful self-restraint; rising, he stepped
<a id="png.243" href="#png.243"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>243<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>up to the young Englishman with an air of heartfelt sympathy
and pressed his hand.</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” he declared, “you are a good and honest
man!”</p>

<p>But Ascott had no illusions. “Or an idiot!” he groaned.</p>

<p>A silence followed, which the detective broke to say:
“You will please excuse me, I must be going,” adding with
a spice of irony:</p>

<p>“I won’t press you to have breakfast with me; I take
it that after the wedding, a <span class="prellips">reception </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>“No!” Ascott interrupted, “don’t make fun of me, Tom
Bob; the ceremony will be strictly private; naturally it
does not call for any festivities; the mother, who has to
signify her consent, only comes to the <i lang="fr">Mairie</i> and to church,
and I have definitely refused to invite to the breakfast
anyone whatsoever besides the witnesses.”</p>

<p>“And you start, no doubt, on your wedding trip afterwards?”</p>

<p>“That is to say,” returned the young man, “I take to my
heels, I go away to hide myself, also I go in order to try
and get my wife away from the deplorable associations
connected with her family and relations.”</p>

<p>As he reached the door Tom Bob turned for a last
good-bye to his host: “As a matter of fact,” he questioned,
“do you love her?”</p>

<p>“No!” replied the rich Englishman gloomily.</p>

<p>But, modifying his statement and blushing to the roots
of his hair, he added:</p>

<p>“Still, I am bound to confess, there is something makes
her not indifferent to me.”</p>

<p>Tom Bob raised his hand as if to invoke heaven, and
in a thrilling voice:</p>

<p>“The child, <span class="prellips">perhaps </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is it,” Ascott agreed, and hurrying over the
good-byes, he returned to his working-table, while the
detective took his departure.</p>

<p class="tb ellips big">* * * * * *</p>

<p>At the far end of the <span lang="fr">Bois de Vincennes</span>, near the <span lang="fr">Saint-Mandé</span>
boundary of the park, is to be found, standing
among trees, a restaurant of quite a rural aspect, and bearing
the significant name of <cite>The Orange Blossom</cite>. Within
are a number of vast rooms and outside in the gardens

that the democracy resorts to make merry on the occasion

one, sometimes the other, occasionally both, have<!-- TN: original reads "have have" -->
been rapidly despatched.</p>

<p>This morning evidently the landlord of <cite>The Orange
Blossom</cite> was not expecting any great number of customers,
for he had thrown open only the smallest of his salons.
In the middle of the room he was laying the table for a
very limited number of guests:</p>

<p>“Scurvy devils!” he was grumbling to himself, “what’s
the good of folks who ask only the marriage witnesses to
the breakfast—skinflints surely! True they’ve paid in
advance without any bargaining much, still in my humble
opinion we’d best keep a sharp eye lifting to see they don’t
pocket the spoons; mostly indeed I keep the silver locked
up. A breakfast for six at six francs a head, that don’t
come to a couple of louis. However, let’s hope we’ll make
it up on the drinks and cigars.”</p>

<p>The good man stopped in his work; someone had entered
the room and was coming towards him.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir,” he said, “but are you the landlord of
<cite>The Orange Blossom</cite>?”</p>

<p>The innkeeper turned to his questioner and looked him
up and down disdainfully. The newcomer was not of a
distinguished appearance—middle-class evidently, soberly
dressed in black, a man of thirty or thereabouts, wearing
a very heavy beard.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he asked him.</p>

<p>“Sir,” asked the stranger in return, “are you by way of
engaging waiters?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” was the uncompromising answer, “and
least of all to-day; why, there’s nothing to do—a meal for
six at six francs a head—I and the maidservant will be
amply sufficient to wait.”</p>

<p>“Still I should be very <span class="prellips">wishful </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>“Nothing doing!”</p>

<p>“Not even if I paid?”</p>

<p>The innkeeper looked wonderingly at the man, surprised
at such persistency.</p>

<p>“What d’you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Look here,” the would-be waiter explained, “I’m very
<a id="png.245" href="#png.245"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>245<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>anxious to wait at table, to wait at this table, it’s a business
I’m keen on. If you’d let me have the tips for myself, I’ll
pay you twenty francs to make it up to you.”</p>

<p>The landlord of <cite>The Orange Blossom</cite> hesitated. The
man’s offer was a good one for him, too good indeed; that
was more or less what made him suspicious, for neither of
the two could fail to know that the tips would never in
the long run reach any such amount. To tell the truth, it
was this very fact that inclined the innkeeper to look upon
the unknown’s application in a favourable light. But he was
still suspicious. Perhaps the fine fellow had some cute
idea at the back of his head, or perhaps he wanted to kick
up a disturbance. Was he a rejected lover, the bride’s fancy
man, or possibly the brother or kinsman of a former mistress
discarded by the bridegroom? One never knows,
such queer things happen! Once more the innkeeper looked
hard at this fellow who was so monstrously eager to take
service with him; he saw the man was calm and composed
enough and had not a bad face of his own.</p>

<p>“Look here,” the landlord of <cite>The Orange Blossom</cite> began
again, “you’re not humbugging me? you want to pay a
louis to wait at table, and you don’t mean to play any
tricks?”</p>

<p>The unknown laughed frankly in the other’s face:</p>

<p>“Why, not a bit of it, sir, that I swear; I tell you, it
amuses me to wait on these people, it’s as you might say,
<span class="prellips">it’s </span><span class="ellips">...</span> it’s a wager I made with my pals.”</p>

<p>“The tips won’t be heavy,” the innkeeper was charitable
enough to warn him.</p>

<p>“That’s all one to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, my fine fellow,” thought the landlord of <cite>The
Orange Blossom</cite>, “you strike me as a mighty queer sort,
but there don’t seem to be any harm in you; after all, what
risk do I run?”</p>

<p>He accepted, and held out his hand to clinch the bargain.
“Agreed,” he cried, “hand over your louis.”</p>

<p>“Here you are, sir!”</p>

<p>“Now, my lad,” continued the boniface, getting on
very familiar terms, “go and fetch an apron and a jacket,
I suppose you have a clean shirt-front; the meal’s ordered
for half past twelve, but I don’t expect our customers
before one o’clock; look’ee, here’s where we put the plates;
<a id="png.246" href="#png.246"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>246<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>about the glasses, you’d better polish ’em up a bit; as
you’ve time to spare, that’ll give you something to do, my
boy. By-the-by, what do they call you?”</p>

<p>After a moment’s hesitation, the new waiter named
himself Daniel.</p>

<p>“Well, Daniel, get to work; work’s the cure for boredom,
you know.”</p>

<p>No sooner was he left alone in the salon where the breakfast
was to be served than this volunteer who had got
himself taken on in so odd a fashion dropped into a chair
and gave a long-drawn sigh!</p>

<p>“Ah!” he ejaculated; “here I am, but it’s an expensive
treat; a louis! no doubt my poor watch, thanks to
‘my uncle’s’ generosity, raised me the money without over
much difficulty—but when shall I ever get my dear ticker
back?” Then: “Good Lord!” he groaned, “how this false
beard does tickle; if only it don’t come ungummed while
I’m waiting at table!”</p>

<p>He got up and went over to a mirror to make sure his
disguise was holding firm. He gazed long at his reflection
in the glass, his eyes full of melancholy.</p>

<p>“I did well to adopt this travesty,” he told himself, “I
am absolutely unrecognizable”—and he was right. The
new waiter of <cite>The Orange Blossom</cite> was, in fact, no other
than <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>.</p>

<p>Ever since the dreadful trial he had gone through, since
the day of <span lang="fr">Elisabeth Dollon’s</span> death, the journalist had
been plunged in a state of terrible prostration. Wild
with grief, he had felt his sanity leaving him; all his high
courage, his generous ardour, had departed, and again and
again the thought of suicide had haunted his mind. It
had called for all the energy that formed the basis of his
character to stay him from proceeding to such dread extremities.</p>

<p>Little by little, however, as his will power mastered his
dejection, a deep, fierce anger seized him and grew stronger
every day. He had a mission to fulfill; this he realized,
and his purposes grew clear and definite. Henceforth it
was not solely his friend <span lang="fr">Juve</span> he must rescue from his
unhappy plight, but there was <span lang="fr">Elisabeth’s</span> fearful death he
was called upon to avenge. And as he considered these
two duties, one as dear to his heart as the other, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
<a id="png.247" href="#png.247"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>247<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>recognized that in reality he was pursuing one and the
same object, for indeed the main author of all these calamities,
the responsible agent, the being who by his sorceries
had sown mourning and desolation round about him, was
still and always the mysterious, the ever elusive <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!
Oh! to unmask the monster, to come face to face with him,
to discover in which of the group among whom he worked
and manœuvred was really and truly incarnate the mysterious
malefactor, this was what the journalist swore to himself
to achieve! At all costs he must get done with it; to
make an end was necessary, indispensable, and that with
the briefest possible delay.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was filled with a new hope. Though still in
hiding from the police and living the life of a pariah, he
was yet able to glean occasional information from casual
conversations and newspapers, and he noted a certain
veering round of public opinion in favour of his friend. It
was impossible, people were saying, that <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, a prisoner
in the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite>, could be guilty of all the murders and robberies
ascribed to the agency of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. To this was added
<span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> definite and undoubted discovery of certain activities
of the gang at whose head old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> figured.
Though kept somewhat at arm’s length by the members
of this gang, the journalist did nevertheless succeed in
learning a number of facts that enabled him to prosecute
his investigations on clear and precise lines. Now he had
lately acquired the certainty that <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> counted for
much in the profitable enterprises engineered by <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.</p>

<p>But where was <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>? Not far off, for certain!
Yet, with equal certainty, more difficult to track down,
more elusive than ever. Nor was it only <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> who was
at fault. The American detective Tom Bob was in the
same predicament. In fact, the latter, despite his fine
audacity and his first triumphs, had not continued his
successes. For quite a long time now people had ceased
to talk about him; he seemed to have lost interest in the
war he had declared against <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.</p>

<p>Furthermore <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had observed that the American,
who on his first arrival had promised him his protection
and support, had suddenly left off seeing him, indeed made
little or no concealment of the fact that he no longer
desired to be in touch with him. Why this change? with
<a id="png.248" href="#png.248"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>248<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>what object in view? Was Tom Bob ashamed to avow
himself beaten? or was he hoping, alone, by himself, to
run <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> to earth?</p>

<p>Such were the young man’s thoughts when the landlord
of <cite>The Orange Blossom</cite> suddenly burst into the eating room.</p>

<p>“Daniel,” he cried, “you must make haste, my lad!
here’s the wedding party coming, they’re not late after all;
quick, put on your apron and jacket, breakfast will be
served <span lang="la">instanter</span>!”</p>

<p>Two landaus had just drawn up at the entrance to the
gardens, two simple, unpretending vehicles, with none of
your wide plate-glass windows, none of your big carriage
lamps at the four corners of the coach.</p>

 ><small>THE WEDDING BREAKFAST</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">As Ascott</span> desired the wedding was carried out in the
strictest privacy. The party reached the <i lang="fr">Mairie</i> at an
early hour. Ascott had for witnesses his man servant
John, and a casual secretary from the Consulate, bound
over to the closest secrecy. Moreover, the young man in
question, a person of much discretion who saw how things
were with half an eye, had vanished immediately after
the ceremony, saying he did not care to attend the breakfast,
understanding in fact that his absence would not be
taken in ill part, but very much the reverse. <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon’s</span>
witnesses were her uncle, <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, recruited again for
the purpose, and the vagabond <span lang="fr">Bouzille</span>, who had been
fetched from a drinking shop at <span lang="fr">Ménilmontant</span>, and dressed
up for the occasion in a second-hand frock coat. The
formalities at the <i lang="fr">Mairie</i> were quickly completed, the
party adjourned to hear a mass at the nearest church, and
then set off for the <span lang="fr">Bois de Vincennes</span>.</p>

<p>The last act of the grotesque adventure, the wedding
breakfast, remained to be staged. Ascott, to <span lang="fr">Mme. Guinon’s</span>
bitter chagrin, had emphatically refused to make her
acquaintance, thereby making the good woman desperately
unhappy. Thus she had barely caught a glimpse of
her son-in-law, when at the <i lang="fr">Mairie</i> she authorized her
daughter as a minor to pronounce a definitive and binding
“Yes.” Ascott, in fact, had shown himself quite uncompromising
all the morning. For this marriage, this hole
and corner marriage, so to speak, in which he had systematically
avoided all publicity, he had not chosen that his
bride should wear the orthodox white gown sacred to such
occasions. In a word, the ceremony was a gloomy, funereal
function, depressing to the last degree.</p>

<p>It was abundantly clear the bridegroom was fulfilling a
duty, carrying out an irksome obligation; indeed, the whole
<a id="png.250" href="#png.250"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>250<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>thing wore so lugubrious an aspect that <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span> began
to feel anxious, asking herself if really and truly she had
acted wisely in following old <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span> advice, for at the
bottom of her heart she was far from convinced of the
advantages to accrue for her from her union with the rich
Englishman. On the drive to the restaurant, sitting silent
in her corner of the carriage, <span lang="fr">Nini</span> was thinking all the
while:</p>

<p>“If I’m in for a bad time, if old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> has got me in a
hole, I’ll make him pay for it.”</p>

<p>However, <span lang="fr">Bouzille</span>, who had kept quiet enough during
the morning, began to liven up on arriving at <cite>The Orange
Blossom</cite>. He smiled broadly at the regiment of bottles
drawn up on a sideboard, and, like the good-natured ninny
he was, having never an inkling of the preposterous situation
of the bridal pair and those about them, he clapped
his hands gaily, suggesting:</p>

<p>“Well, good folks, about time for a bit of a spree, eh?
what if we cracked a bottle now before going any further?”</p>

<p>Ascott, for all his pre-occupation, could not help smiling;
in fact, if there was any one person in the whole crew that
revolted him less profoundly than the rest, it was certainly
this merry-hearted tramp; the fellow was rough and brutal,
but he seemed to be an honest man. On the contrary,
Ascott felt greatly embarrassed at the idea of sitting down
to table with his servant; in his own mind he decided there
was only one thing to be done—to send the man about his
business that very evening. Besides, <cite>The Orange Blossom</cite>
itself was little to his taste. What a place! What a
vulgar show!</p>

<p>Still, he must make the best of things, and taking
<span lang="fr">Bouzille’s</span> hint, Ascott called the waiter and demanded
drinks. And it was no other than <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> who stepped
forward to take the rich Englishman’s order.</p>

<p>Without more ado, Ascott took his seat, putting <span lang="fr">Nini</span>
on his right and old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> on his left; this done, he kept
his eyes fixed on the table-cloth, not knowing in the least
which way to look or what to do. <span lang="fr">Bouzille’s</span> fine enthusiasm
had suddenly quieted down, while the rest of the company
were not “playing up” one bit: there they sat, each
more stockish than the other. If anybody had come in
hopes of diversion, he was finding himself singularly
<a id="png.251" href="#png.251"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>251<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>disappointed. John, sitting facing his master, dared not utter
a word, <span lang="fr">Moche</span> never opened his lips, <span lang="fr">Nini</span> was cross and
angry, Ascott pale and silent as the grave!</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, with the landlord’s help—for the journalist had
proved himself from the very start a most indifferent waiter—served
the first course, during which not half-a-dozen
words were spoken. The landlord, when he found himself
in the kitchen again, alone with <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, could not hide
his surprise.</p>

<p>“For the last twenty years,” he declared, “I’ve had wedding-parties
here, I’ve known customers of every sort
and kind, but anything like those folks yonder—never!
They couldn’t be more dismal if it was a funeral they’d
been at!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ascott sat deep in thought; he was realizing
the appalling folly he had been guilty of in marrying <span lang="fr">Nini
Guinon</span>.</p>

<p>“How could I ever for one single instant have entertained
such an <span class="prellips">idea </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and put it into execution?”</p>

<p>But the unfortunate young man quickly called to mind
that, if he had not followed the injunctions of <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>,
the plaint lodged by the <span lang="fr">Guinon</span> family would have taken
its course, and that would have equally involved disgrace,
disgrace more terrible still, more irremediable even than
the grotesque marriage he had just contracted. Ascott
saw clear now—he was the victim of an odious piece of
blackmailing, an abominable plot. He was so worked up
he felt himself prepared to do the maddest things, he
meditated going straight to the <span lang="fr">Procureur de la République</span>
to denounce the whole business<span class="ellips">....</span> But the unhappy
man, when he looked closer into this last desperate resource,
realized that the situation was past cure, that no one could
help him, that he was simply a victim, and a ridiculous
victim at that, and that, in fact, there was something else,
something more serious, which after all tied his hands and
gave him pause. <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span> was <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>; he must not,
he could not forget that fact. Ascott could stand no more
of it; still controlling his feelings, he leant over to his wife,
sitting next him, and whispered:</p>

<p>“I am a little unwell, so I am going to withdraw into
some room near; I count on being left to myself, and shall
expect you to join me there when you have finished
<a id="png.252" href="#png.252"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>252<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>breakfast.” <span lang="fr">Nini</span> had scarcely gathered the sense of her husband’s
words before the latter had disappeared.</p>

<p>In a moment, as if by enchantment, all recovered their
spirits; they clinked glasses, they drained bumpers, they
ate with a better appetite, gaiety reigned on every face:
decidedly, the English milord had done well to leave them
to themselves; they would be more of a family party,
more at their ease.</p>

<p>“Say, <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>,” observed <span lang="fr">Bouzille</span>, “he don’t strike
me as being much of a gallant, your niece’s husband! how’s
she going to hit it off, little <span lang="fr">Nini</span>, with a lump of wood like
that, eh?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you trouble your head,” broke in the girl, “I
know what I’ve got to do.”</p>

<p>Then, as everybody stopped talking to listen:</p>

<p>“Jabber away amongst yourselves,” she growled, “I’m
going to have a talk with <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>.”</p>

<p>The talk became general, while a very animated discussion
began between <span lang="fr">Nini</span> and her reputed uncle.</p>

<p>“If you think it’s any fun,” began the young woman,
“this marriage you’ve brought about, I tell you I’m about
fed up with it already. I don’t give myself eight and
forty hours before I hook it from my husband.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Nini</span>, you’re a born fool: a bit of patience, my lass,
and you’ll see <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> was in the right.” Then, in a
lower tone: “You’re far too pretty and too clever to
spend all your young days among this crowd, a parcel of
rotters who’re good for nothing but talking loud and getting
drunk. I’ve told you, haven’t I, I’d make you rich, I’d
make a great lady of you, more than that, a queen of beauty,
a queen of Paris, a queen of society! Play your cards, <span lang="fr">Nini</span>,
listen to me<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>A gleam of covetousness flashed in the girl’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I shall be rich?” she questioned, “I shall have the
nibs?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> went on:</p>

<p>“Rich, and better than rich, my girl; but for that don’t
go and play the fool; just keep yourself in hand for another
nine months. Your brat must come into the world strong
and healthy; after that there’ll be something new to think
about, you can trust <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> for that!”</p>

<p><a id="png.253" href="#png.253"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>253<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>While the young Englishman’s queer helpmeet and the
enigmatical personage who had passed himself off as her
uncle for his own ends were thus debating future projects,
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor</span>, under pretence of paying every attention
to the customers’ wants, was never far from the table,
picking up scraps of talk as he hovered near. And in spite
of himself, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> could not keep his eyes off <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span>
face. As he stood over him, he could, for the first time,
observe otherwise than through the glass of his spectacles
the mysterious old fellow’s eyes. And they disconcerted
the journalist extremely, their clear, cold, steely glance
perplexed him beyond measure. Most certainly <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
could trace no likeness there, he had no recollection of
having seen that expression before; yet it seemed to him
that a person like the old business agent of the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>,
whose caricature of a face betrayed the man’s commonness
of type, <em>could</em> not have such a look of the eyes as
he actually had.</p>

<p>And, as a fact, who and what was this man who—<span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
saw it all—had conceived so Machiavellian a scheme as
that of marrying the street wench <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span> to Ascott,
the wealthy Englishman of the <span lang="fr">Rue Fortuny</span>, and who,
having conceived, had carried it through!</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span lang="fr" class="prellips">Fantômas? </span><span class="prellips"><span class="ellips">...?</span> </span><span class="ellips">...?</span></p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, as the result of a series of logical deductions,
possibly also through giving a certain weight to the presentiments
that rarely deceived him, had come to ask
himself if the man of the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>, really too
mysterious a personage, was not one of the incarnations of
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> himself. Since he had been watching his man,
and particularly since he had seen his eyes and their expression,
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> clung more and more closely to this
opinion.</p>

<p>Ah! if only he were right! if he had discovered the
villain? That would be an extraordinarily fine trump card
for him in the grim game he was playing with <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> as
adversary! And now, many hitherto unexplained details
recurred to his memory. Notably he recalled the strange
apparition of the man in the black mask on that terrible
night he had spent in <span lang="fr">M. Moche’s</span> garret. He did not forget
how on that occasion <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, under pretence of safeguarding
him from harm, had involved him in the direst
<a id="png.254" href="#png.254"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>254<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>peril, evidently in the hope that the police would discover
him hidden in the Chinese lantern.</p>

<p>“Why,” he thought presently, “but why did not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
kill me when he had this chance? that is what I
cannot understand.”</p>

<p>But, when he examined the question more deeply, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
realized the fact that <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> crimes invariably
had a double object—to get rid of an obnoxious adversary
and at the same time to throw suspicions on the dead man
that went to prove by their very nature the innocence of
some accomplice of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> or of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> himself. Thus
he pondered, all the while carrying on with the utmost awkwardness
his duties as a waiter, under the wary and ever
watchful eye of the landlord of <cite>The Orange Blossom</cite>.</p>

<p>At the same time <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> did not allow his attention to
be absorbed solely by the conversation between <span lang="fr">Moche</span>
and <span lang="fr">Nini</span>. A short while before Ascott had left the rest
of the party—it was an incident which had, in fact, contributed
not a little to the rising nausea that had driven
the young Englishman from the table—two of the apache
gang, the same two, “Bull’s-eye” and the “Gasman” who
had signalized themselves in the <cite>Silver Goblet</cite> affair and at
the unpleasant interview with the Police Commissary,
appearing unexpectedly within sight of the window, had
been invited to join the wedding feast by the irrepressible
<span lang="fr">Bouzille</span>. The two intruders were now seated at the table,
and the <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> waiter made a point of plying them with
drink and incidentally catching up any fragments of their
talk that struck him as being to the point. The apaches,
in ambiguous terms, but in a fashion explicit enough for
<span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> comprehension, were discussing recent enterprises
in which the gang had been mixed up. It became very
evident that a unanimous and general feeling of suspicion
and ill-will towards <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> was growing up among the
criminal confraternity. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, they muttered, used
everybody for his own purposes, forced each man to risk
his skin and in the end compensated nobody. In covert
phrases, too, they spoke of <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, who, they hinted,
must know all about <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, and whose task was always
to pour oil on the troubled waters, who was for ever putting

yesterday, in one word playing a double game.</p>

 ></span></span></a>“Oh!” grumbled the “Gasman,” while <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was refilling
his glass, “things can’t go on no longer like this,
to-morrow night and the hour sounds for definite and final
explanations; we want our money, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> will have to
answer our questions.”</p>

<p>“Bull’s-eye” bent over to his comrade, and in his hoarse
voice asked:</p>

<p>“So the <i lang="fr">rendez-vous</i> still holds good at the same place,
eh?”</p>

<p>At that moment <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was obliged to go away, <span lang="fr">M. Moche</span> was calling him; nevertheless the journalist had
gathered from a remark of the “Gasman’s” that the following
night there was to be a meeting of the gang on the
outskirts of the city, close down by the banks of the <span lang="fr">Seine</span>
at the far end of <span lang="fr">Alfort</span>.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">A superb limousine had drawn up at the back of the
restaurant of <cite>The Orange Blossom</cite>. It was about four of
the afternoon: the breakfast had resolved itself into a
drunken debauch, a horrid uproar of ribald songs disturbed
the quiet of the establishment. <span lang="fr">Bouzille</span> was the noisiest
of them all; the wine bottles had been left on the table
at the end of the meal, in an hour’s time they had to be
replaced. Ascott, heedless of the whole riot, had paid without
a murmur.</p>

<p>Ten minutes ago <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>, at <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span> urgent suggestion,
had gone to join her husband, who had spent a strange
afternoon for a bridegroom, shut up alone in a room on the
first floor, anxiously awaiting, not so much the return of
his wife, as the arrival of the motor-car he had ordered,
eager to escape from Paris with all speed and hide himself
and his intolerable situation in some remote corner of the
provinces. Hardly had <span lang="fr">Nini</span> appeared, all flushed and
excited, before Ascott, looking her coldly up and down,
ordered her:</p>

<p>“Put on your hat, we are going.”</p>

<p>Furious at bottom to be so treated, but scared by her
husband’s manner, and also remembering old <span lang="fr">Moche’s</span>
counsels, she obeyed, muttering curses under her breath;
“He shall pay me for this, come the day I can bring him
to heel.”</p>

<p>Hastily she put on a long dust-cloak, settled her hat in
<a id="png.256" href="#png.256"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>256<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>place and followed her husband and the two, without a
word of good-bye to anyone, got into the car, which started
away at once. <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, however, had run up hastily
to see the last of them; with a wave of the hand he bade
farewell to the newly-wed pair, a broad, ironical smile on
his lips.</p>

<p>But suddenly he started back. An explosion had rung
out, half an inch more and <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> would have received
a bullet full in the face. Luckily he had foreseen the shot
and ducked in time. With amazing agility, <span lang="fr">Moche</span> sprang
at his assailant, whom he hurled to the ground, keeping
him down with a knee pressed hard on the fellow’s chest.</p>

<p>“Brigand! scoundrel! I don’t know what stops me from
killing you here and now!”</p>

<p>Who was this man <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> had mastered so adroitly?
No other than <span lang="fr">Paulet, Nini Guinon’s</span> lover, the white-faced,
pale-eyed scamp who had assuredly been completely
sacrificed in the old usurer’s sinister machinations. With
calm ferocity the latter was now brandishing the revolver
he had snatched from the apache’s hands.</p>

<p>“One word, one movement,” he declared, “and I blow
your brains out, as you tried to blow out mine the day of
the bank messenger’s death. Villain! murderer! Remember
I hold your life in my hands, that I can do for you where I
choose and when I choose.”</p>

<p>“Scoundrel!” vociferated <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, “you’ve robbed me of
my doxy, what d’you think is to become of me now?”</p>

<p>“Fool! she wanted to be done with you!”</p>

<p>“Ah! if you hadn’t hid her away, you old rascal, if only
I could have seen her!”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> ordered him to hold his tongue. It needed
all his strength to keep the apache down. <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, savage
and desperate, had managed with his right hand to grasp
the barrel of the revolver, and was holding it away from
his body; it looked as if he might renew the struggle,
perhaps floor the old man in his turn. The two wretches
fought furiously for some seconds, now one, now the other
momentarily getting the upper hand; the two rolled over
and over in the dust. At last <span lang="fr">Moche</span> succeeded in gripping
the young apache’s throat between his powerful fingers,
after forcing him to let go the revolver.</p>

<p>“Die, then,” yelled <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, “die, as you won’t give in!”</p>

<p><a id="png.257" href="#png.257"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>257<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Oh! oh!” stammered <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> in a broken voice, “Curse
it, curse my luck! will no one save me?”</p>

<p>Suddenly the two combatants were dragged apart. In
answer to <span lang="fr">Paulet’s</span> cry for help, someone shouted in a ringing
voice: “I will.”</p>

<p>The someone had picked up the revolver that had been
dropped in the struggle and stood with it in his hand.
Dazed and dumbfounded, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> gazed open-mouthed at
his preserver, whom he did not know. <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>, for his
part, saw that the person who had just intervened between
them in the battle was no other than the servant at the
restaurant who had waited at breakfast.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> stared at the man, scrutinizing his face with concentrated
attention; suddenly he broke into a cry:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, in heaven’s name!” he exclaimed, “you blackguard,
I didn’t recognize you before<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>At the name of <span lang="fr">Fandor, Paulet</span> sprang up and ranged
himself instinctively by the journalist’s side; while <span lang="fr">Père
Moche</span> realized the time was not come to continue the discussion.
Besides which, the landlord of <cite>The Orange Blossom</cite>
now came running up from the penetralia of his
establishment with very natural curiosity:</p>

<p>“What is up now?” he demanded, “I seem to have
heard an explosion, like a revolver shot.”</p>

<p>Mine host looked hard at the three men, standing there
with torn clothes, all filthy and smothered in dust; but
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was ready with a plausible explanation. He gave
his account with perfect self-possession:</p>

<p>“It’s nothing, landlord, only the customer’s car burst a
tyre just now and we’ve been helping to mend it; it was
a case of creeping in under the chassis, that’s how we’re a
bit dirty, but a clothes brush’ll soon put that to rights!”</p>

<p>The landlord asked no more questions, and the four men
returned quietly to the restaurant, but three of them were
well aware that this tranquillity was only apparent. It
was but a truce before the battle, for war seemed henceforth
to be definitely declared.</p>

 ><small>PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">It</span> was nine o’clock, and the storm was at its height. The
rain came down in torrents, the wind blew fiercely, lightning
blazed and thunder bellowed. The streets were deserted,
for a man must indeed have had urgent business to call
him abroad on such a night.</p>

<p>Apparently such was <span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor’s</span> case, for the
journalist was walking fast and resolutely under the pitiless
downpour along the quays bordering the Seine in the direction
of <span lang="fr">Charenton</span>. As he fought his way against the gale,
the belated pedestrian was growling between his teeth:</p>

<p>“Good lord! how my ears sting with the cold! and
how pitch dark it is! Screw up my eyes as I will, I can’t
see a thing. All the same, I’ve got to get to <span lang="fr">Alfort</span>; but
shall I ever find the <i lang="fr">rendez-vous</i> in this darkness, I wonder!
All the same, how right I was to attend the marriage of that
fool Ascott with the unspeakable <span lang="fr">Nini Guinon</span>! What a
wedding! and what a crew! And old <span lang="fr">Moche</span>! what a clever
fellow he must be to keep this gang of scoundrels on the
job, always promising the fellows money and never giving
them the pay for the crimes they do at his bidding! Oh!
he’s one in a thousand, he is, the old money-lender of the
<span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>! If I hadn’t important reasons for
not wishing him to see me, I’d just go straight, fair and
square, to the abandoned quarry where the confabulation’s
to be between the ‘Gasman,’ ‘Bull’s-eye,’<!-- TN: apostrophe inserted for consistency --> <span lang="fr">Paulet</span> and the rest
of that gang of ruffians. But surely I hear footsteps coming
up behind me. Best turn off the road now and make to the
right to get time to find a hiding place. Mustn’t let yourself
be seen, friend <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>. True, all these chaps are your
‘pals’ and more or less well disposed; but ’ware <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, if
<em>he</em> spotted you, especially after yesterday’s business, there’d
be trouble, and that wouldn’t help on poor <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> affairs!”</p>

<p>All the while, as he soliloquized thus, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was moving
<a id="png.259" href="#png.259"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>259<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>on as fast as he could in the deep shadows that helped to
conceal him, sometimes crawling, sometimes walking. Still,
he was the first to reach the <i lang="fr">rendez-vous</i>. It was a sinister
spot. A sand quarry lay there abandoned, a hundred yards
from the bank of the river. A strike of the quarrymen
had been on foot for a week, and there appeared no present
likelihood of work being resumed. <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> henchmen
were aware of the fact and knew that nobody would come
to disturb them. Besides, the river was close at hand, and
if interruptors appeared, so much the worse for them!
They would make a hole in the water, whether they liked
a bath or no.</p>

<p>But the look of things would not have been half so grim
if, moored by the shore, a dredger had not shown its huge,
dark bulk on the black water, lifting to the sky its slanting
spar with an endless chain running along its length carrying
the great buckets that dredge up the mud and detritus from
the bed of the stream.</p>

<p>A sound of footsteps. A cold sweat broke out on <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span>
temples; like all truly brave men, he was not rash
and deemed it foolish to risk his life without gain for anybody
or anything whatsoever. Now it was very certain
that, if he was seen by <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, who knew him, and now
treated him openly as an enemy, he would be denounced to
the apaches, who would no longer take him to be one of
their own crew and would dub him a traitor. A summary
execution would be the sequel. But what would become
of <span lang="fr">Juve</span> then? Anyway, what was to be done now under
these difficult circumstances? The intrepid journalist asked
himself the question anxiously, calling up all his ingenuity
and cunning to discover an immediate answer, for it was not
hours now that counted, but seconds.</p>

<p>The footsteps came nearer. They were within a hundred
yards and the new arrivals would soon be able to pierce the
heavy shadows that, luckily for <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, still hung, a protective
screen, between them and the reporter. A happy
thought! a really brilliant idea! Those great buckets
(empty or full, what matter?) that swung in the wind along
the dredger’s spar, were they not observatories all ready
made, so excellently adapted to the purpose that assuredly
it would never occur to the most suspiciously minded of
the gang that a spy, however rash, should have chosen so
<a id="png.260" href="#png.260"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>260<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>perilous a hiding place. <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> did not lose a moment.
Rapidly and dexterously the young man hauled himself
up by the chain and had very soon reached the highest
point of the spar, where he settled himself, crouching down
in the topmost bucket of all. By great good luck it was
empty. From there he could both see and hear, while remaining
entirely incognito himself.</p>

<p>He was only just in time. The apaches were arriving
one after the other in quick succession. “Big Ernestine”
was the first; behind her came <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, the murderer of the
bank messenger, the “Gasman,” “Bull’s-eye,” the “Beadle,”
and other members of the gang, after them, five or six new
recruits, whom <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> only knew by sight, and who had
as yet done little to get themselves talked about. These
were whispering together under their breath. The rest
seemed quite at home, they believed themselves as much
alone as in their regular haunts, and their voices swelled
to the loudest diapason of indignation.</p>

<p>“Eleven gone, and the dirty scamp’s not come! it’s over
long the thief’s been chousing us all with his promises he
never keeps. Won’t stand the cheat any more, what say
you, mates?”</p>

<p>“If old man <span lang="fr">Moche</span> tries on another of his tricks to-night,
I’ll do him in to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Hark there! what’s that?”</p>

<p>“It’s the old humbug here at last! oh, ho! his pockets are
bulging with brass; that’s why he’s been so slow; it’s over
heavy for him, he can’t walk!”—and the yells and imprecations
broke out afresh.</p>

<p>A small, mean, cringing figure, his head almost buried
in the collar of his great-coat, his hands clasped in a suppliant
attitude, the old usurer listened quietly to the recriminations
that rose on all sides, guessing that for sure he
would be in the tightest of tight places before long.</p>

<p>“Good day to you, mates all,” he greeted the angry
crowd, and said no more for the moment. But, after a brief
pause, seeing looks of anger and suspicion scanning him
from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head, he added
in a whining voice:</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, but we’d be better elsewhere: suppose we
adjourn to the deck of the <cite lang="fr">Marie-Salope</cite> (the dredger) over
there?”</p>

<p><a id="png.261" href="#png.261"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>261<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><!-- TN: superfluous opening quote removed -->All agreed; only “Bull’s-eye” slipped in a question:
“There’s nobody there?”</p>

<p>A general shout reassured him: “Why, who’d ever dare
to come?”</p>

<p>Still, by way of further precaution, “Big Ernestine”
climbed down into the lighter, moored in the wake of the
dredger, into which the buckets when working emptied
their contents. Another minute and the woman was up
again, satisfied with her inspection, and declaring:</p>

<p>“All clear!”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Moche</span> now pointed out that they were wasting
precious time, gassing without saying anything to the
point.</p>

<p>“We’re here to talk business, so let’s begin.”</p>

<p>The company took seats as they best could, some on the
bulwarks, some on the deck-planks of the dredger, forming
a circle in the middle of which <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> took his stand—and
the trial opened. “Trial” is the right word, for truly
the speaker was pleading for his life before his judges
seated round him, whom even a superficial observer would
have found no difficulty in recognizing as ready to go to
the most violent extremities.</p>

<p>It was the “Beadle” who undertook the prosecution.
All the while brandishing before the face of the culprit,
who stood impassive before him, his redoubtable clenched
fists, the weight of which was familiar to all the onlookers
and which without an effort could have felled the unhappy
old man to the ground, he began with an artful reference
that instantly won him the sympathy of his audience.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>,” he said, “you are come, and that is well,
for it behooves us once for all to understand each other,
us and you. You can see for yourself, that, among the
chosen few of our band, one only is missing, poor ‘Beauty
Boy,’ and if he has been nabbed, if he is in the stone
jug, waiting till the bigwigs send him overseas, that is
entirely your fault; I don’t mean to say you sold him to
the ’tecs<!-- TN: apostrophe added for consistency -->, but you left him without coin, without a yellow
boy, without a stiver, and forced him to muck it somehow
or other, so <span class="prellips">that </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>A triple round of applause allowed the orator to take
breath, which he did long and noisily, and to add another
touch:</p>

<p><a id="png.262" href="#png.262"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>262<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Yes, if ‘Beauty Boy’ was pinched working the Yankees
on the Trans-Atlantic boat-train, and he so clever fingered,
it was because he didn’t have the usual stuff with him.
If he hadn’t been forced to pick up just anything he could
to fill his belly, he would never <span class="prellips">have </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>Faces grew ugly, fists clenched, every eye glittered with
murderous light. In his hiding-place <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> congratulated
himself on his presence at this unexpected scene.
<span lang="fr">Moche</span> seemed to be racking his brains to find a way to
exculpate himself. Still the old ruffian managed to conceal
his distress, and it was without any great difficulty he
succeeded in breaking in on the “Beadle’s” eloquence and
making himself heard instead.</p>

<p>“Come, come, you’re never going to eat me, comrades?
I’ve got a tough hide, you know, and you’d only get a
belly-ache. Now what makes you go howling at me that
gate when I’m your best chum? What have you against
me, now?”</p>

<p>“The infernal cheek of the chap!” snorted out “Big
Ernestine,” looking as red as a poppy.</p>

<p>“But come now, haven’t I done everything I ought?
Sure enough, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, who set us to work, don’t pay us
as we hoped he would. There’s been some good business
done, I admit, and without you, without us, it would never
have come off. Coin’s been handled by the chief, and it’s
all stuck to his fingers, we’ve not had a chance yet to touch
it. But I’m not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, I’m only his lieutenant, and
to pass on your complaint to him, I should have to know
where he is<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>“You don’t know where <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is? D’ye think we’re
going to swallow that humbug?” vociferated “Big Ernestine.”</p>

<p>“No, I do not know, my pretty dear, and if I did, I
should have told you long ago, if only to satisfy your
curiosity.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a plant, that?” asked the “Gasman,” half inclined
to come to the old fellow’s help.</p>

<p>“I swear it isn’t! You think I know more than you do,
and that my lot’s more enviable. Nobody so blind as those
who won’t see. I tell you my look-out is just as pitiable
as yours. He owes you your pay, well, he owes me mine,
too. All I’ve been able to do for you is to hinder your
<a id="png.263" href="#png.263"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>263<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>getting disheartened and thinking <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> doesn’t care
for you any more. Well, <em>I</em>’m convinced <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> still
looks after us and thinks a deal of us. If we don’t see him,
if we have no direct news from him, it’s because he has
powerful reasons for acting as he does<span class="ellips">....</span> What, isn’t
a chap like him cleverer than all the lot of us?”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear! <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> for ever!”</p>

<p>“Well and good! <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> for ever<span class="ellips">!...</span> So then, I
still deserve your confidence, eh? I was to come here to
explain things. Haven’t I come? did I shirk away?”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough; but where is the Chief?”</p>

<p>“Where he is precisely, he’d be a mighty cute customer
who could tell us and be sure he was not mistaken. What is
unfortunately certain is that he must have been put in
confinement as from time to time we receive orders from
the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite> prison, orders we have, in fact, always faithfully
carried out. And all the same, with <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, we are
bound to look for the most amazing surprises<span class="ellips">....</span> Oh! if
only we could see him!”</p>

<p>“We can if we want to!” declared the “Beadle” in a
tone of conviction.</p>

<p>Everyone was startled at this bold statement spoken
with such confidence, while <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> felt his curiosity more
keenly excited than ever.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, we can see him. If <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> writes from
the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite>, that means he is there. If he’s there, we must
manage his escape, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You’re not a bit gone in the head, eh?” someone broke
the silent pause of stupefaction that followed.</p>

<p>“I! not a bit of it; I’ve got my notion, and I’m just
telling you what it is, and if you’re not chicken-hearted, it’ll
come off. It’s not so hard as all that to find a crack
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> can slip out of gaol by<span class="ellips">....</span> Suppose we collar
him as they’re taking him along down the passages in the
<span lang="fr">Palais de Justice</span> to be examined, eh? We’ve done bigger
jobs than that before now. <span class="prellips">Only </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>“Only?”</p>

<p>“Only we must have a plan, and it’s none so easy to
find a good one. It’s not to praise up <span lang="fr">Moche</span> I’m saying
it, but there, he’s a mighty clever chap, and can read a heap
of big old books and write like a schoolmaster.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span> was flattered and gave a little nod of the head,
<a id="png.264" href="#png.264"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>264<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as much as to say they were quite in the right about him
and the profundity of his acquirements. Then the “Beadle”
seeing his audience hanging on his lips, went on with redoubled
ardour:</p>

<p>“Well, then, to my thinking we shall do nothing to rights
without <span lang="fr">Moche</span>; let him make out a plan and we’ll carry
it through<!-- TN: original reads "throught" -->, dead or alive. I have spoken. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> for
ever!”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> for ever!”</p>

<p>Looking on from his point of vantage, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was prodigiously
interested in what he now saw and heard; for
all the wealth of the Indies he would not have surrendered
his place to anyone whatsoever. But suddenly the journalist
felt his heart stop beating at a thought that filled
him with consternation; he shuddered as he reflected on
the apaches’ new project. If, by any chance, this bold
scheme of rescue which the gang proposed proved successful,
it was not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> they would lay hands on, but simply
<span lang="fr">Juve</span>! The fact was, the <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> of the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite>—<span lang="fr">Moche</span>,
indeed, must know this as certainly as <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> did himself—was
not <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> at all, but <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, and once the police-officer
fell into the power of the apaches, he was irremediably
lost, whether they took him for <span lang="fr">Juve</span> or for <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
their perjured and bankrupt paymaster.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had guessed right; this he gathered from the
decision the artful old schemer now pronounced in half a
dozen short, crisp words: “I’ll take it on; to-morrow we
meet again.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet, I must think it over, and once my
plan is settled, I will let you know by <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>. Is that
agreed?”</p>

<p>“Agreed!”</p>

<p>“Nothing more to do here then. Let’s be off and have
a cosy drink; it’ll be warmer than here, what say you?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking. Let’s hook it”—and thus the sitting
was dissolved. Threatening dire disaster to <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> at
the beginning, it had ended finally in a blaze of triumph
for that astute scoundrel.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> found it hard to recover from his wonder and
surprise; true, his poor body was aching and stiff and
cramped, and his mind was feeling the numbing effects of
<a id="png.265" href="#png.265"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>265<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>this physical distress, patiently borne, but prolonged almost
beyond human endurance. However, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was
young and energetic, and very soon, by dint of clinging to
the chain and so stretching himself vigorously, he had
restored the requisite suppleness to legs and arms and
loins; he was making ready, grasping the spar of the <cite lang="fr">Marie-Salope</cite>,
to slip down to the deck when, looking before him,
he caught sight of a shadowy figure returning hurriedly to
the dredger. In a moment he was curled up once more in
the bottom of the bucket, but by tilting this over side-ways,
he managed to secure a still better view than before.</p>

<p>It was a wise precaution, and it proved useful. There
was no doubt about it; some member of the gang was coming
back, after leaving his confederates under some pretext
or other, to return to Paris by themselves. But who was it?
and what was he after?</p>

<p>For all the cool presence of mind that characterized
him, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> with difficulty stifled the cry that rose to his
lips. It was <span lang="fr">Moche</span>! it was indeed <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, who, after
accompanying the apaches for five hundred yards or so as
far as the fork of the roads that lead in different directions
to Paris and to <span lang="fr">Alfort</span>, had announced in the most natural
way in the world:</p>

<p>“I am expected at <span lang="fr">Alfort</span>, so I must leave you here. I’m
not in your bad books any more?”</p>

<p>“No, no<span class="ellips">!...</span> to-morrow’s the day?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow or next day, not a day later. So once
again: <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> for ever!”</p>

<p>“Yes, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> for ever!” echoed “Big Ernestine,”
“<span class="ellips">...</span> but only if he pays up and can prove he hasn’t
choused us!”</p>

<p>“By God! yes, we’ll keep our eyes lifting,” added the
“Gasman,” completing the other worthy’s meaning.
“Till we meet again!”</p>

<p>“So long then!”—and <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, without rousing the
slightest suspicion, had contrived to start back on his
road to the dredger. What was he coming to do? Something
underhand, evidently, for instead of advancing as
the first time, walking quietly on his two feet, he was flat
on his belly, crawling on the ground, as he had been doing
for the last two hundred yards or more. Whose notice
was the old scamp trying to evade? Doubtless it was one
<a id="png.266" href="#png.266"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>266<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the companions he had just left that he feared. <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
was burning with impatience, albeit the temperature had
fallen at the approach of the dawn, which was due in
another hour. Moreover, a heavy, drenching rain-storm
was beginning, accompanied by vivid flashes of forked
lightning and reverberating thunderclaps.</p>

<p>On reaching the dredger, <span lang="fr">Moche</span> abandoned his serpentine
mode of advance and rising to his feet, stepped on to the
deck and made straight for the winding-crank fixed at
the bottom end of the spar, to put the buckets in motion.
He took the handle in both hands and with legs wide
astraddle and back hunched up, set to work to turn.
Looking down at the old chap from above, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> could
not restrain a laugh.</p>

<p>“Sweat away!” he grinned, “I’ll give you a dozen of
champagne if you get the old machine to <span class="prellips">work </span><span class="ellips">...</span> God
in heaven! it <em>is</em> turning.”</p>

<p>He had not time to say another word before he was
pitched headlong into the lighter astern, among the rubbish
that already half filled it and which, luckily for him, made
a sort of cushion sufficiently yielding to break his fall.
Nor had he time to get to his feet before the contents of
the bucket that had previously hung below him, but was
now suspended above his head as the chain revolved, came
tumbling all over him.</p>

<p>“Bad luck again!” was all he said, as he shifted quickly
a bit to one side, so as not to be fouled again if <span lang="fr">Moche</span>
went on working the crank, which had gone on turning
without further application of external force. But what
now? the avalanche had stopped; what did that mean?
Peeping out through the cracks in the ramshackle bulwarks
of the lighter, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> could get an excellent view of what
old <span lang="fr">Moche</span> might be at without any risk of being seen
himself. What he did see was so singular that his face
lit up with a broad smile. Something was afoot of so
strange a sort as to force an involuntary exclamation from
his lips. “The artful dodger!” he ejaculated. What the
old usurer of the <span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span> was doing was, in
fact, extraordinary. He had stopped the crank at the
exact moment when the first bucket under water rose
from the depths of the dredger’s hold. At this the old
man was gazing lovingly, and it was only after he had
<a id="png.267" href="#png.267"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>267<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cast a wary glance round the horizon and made sure there
was no one watching his proceedings that he began groping
in it with feverish eagerness. <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> grinned like a
Cheshire cat, chuckling to himself as he mentally apostrophized
the old fellow:</p>

<p>“Oh, <span lang="fr">Moche, Moche</span>, what a fool you are!—and just
when you’re thinking yourself the cleverest rogue unhung!
What is the fellow after? By the Lord, he’s hauling out
of the mud an iron box, a cashbox. Full of yellow boys,
I wager. Egad, there’s enough and to spare there to pay
the greediest of <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> regular workers for their trouble!
<span lang="fr">Moche</span>, my boy, if I wanted to play you a nasty trick,
I’d go slap off and tell the gang what I’ve seen, and I
promise you that, two hours from now, when they’d caught
you, you’d be having a devilish bad half-hour! Luckily
for you, I prefer, in <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> interests, to find out what you’re
proposing to do with your treasure. Are you an honest
agent, is it just a trust confided to you by <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>? <em>Or</em>,
are you by way of robbing your master and all his confederates?
Oh, ho! it looks as if the villain is preparing
to answer my question himself.”</p>

<p>For now, with a meditative air, <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was pulling at
his hideous red whiskers, one after the other. Then he
took out his watch and made several unavailing attempts
to see the time, for the night was still so dark he had to
wait for a flash of lightning before he could read the hour,
while the wind was blowing too violently for him to dream
of lighting a match. When at last he was able to make
out the face, a cry of annoyance broke from his lips:
“Gone three already!”—and without a moment’s delay
he started off at a run in the direction of <span lang="fr">Alfort</span>, gripping
under his left arm the precious box, which he had hastily
reclosed.</p>

<p>Where was he off to? <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> took prompt measures
to find out, and the other had not gone three hundred
paces before his steps were being dogged by the pursuing
journalist. The pace was hot. It was plain that <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span>
man of business was bent on completing before daylight
whatever the job it was he had made up his mind to do. But
to manage it he must make all possible haste, for, as
<span lang="fr">Moche</span> had noted, it was by now three o’clock in the
morning.</p>

<p><a id="png.268" href="#png.268"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>268<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“God Almighty!” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> swore, pressing on harder still,
“what a racer the scoundrel is<span class="ellips">!...</span> Where are we? We’re
clean through <span lang="fr">Alfort</span>, and there’s nothing else but that
hovel ahead there; it looks deserted, but it’s that way
and nowhere else <span lang="fr">Moche</span> is making across country. Ah, ha!
I think I’m going to know!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Moche</span>, in fact, was making straight for a tumble-down
building that stood empty and abandoned in the middle
of a wide stretch of waste ground, its shutters hanging from
their hinges, its walls dropping to pieces, and a general
look of poverty-stricken dilapidation brooding over all.
Like a person familiar with the locality and having a
perfect right to march in without knocking, he pushed
open the door, a strong and heavy one. Still, the idea
occurred to him that tramps might have taken refuge in
the ramshackle hut for shelter from the cold out of doors;
so he took his revolver in hand, and in he went.</p>

<p>The old usurer reclosed the door behind him; then
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, who had been crouching to the ground, advanced
with a thousand precautions, glued his ear to the door,
made certain that the outermost room was unoccupied,
and opening in his turn, made his way silently into the
lonely house. Neither did he fail to hold his trusty Browning
ready for action. At first he had some difficulty in
making out just where <span lang="fr">Moche</span> could be, but soon, noticing
a feeble, almost imperceptible glimmer of light that filtered
up through the floor, he realized that the old usurer was in
a cellar, and had pulled to after him the trap-door by
which he had gained access. <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> threw himself flat on
the trap-door in question and peeped through the cracks
between the boards.</p>

<p>But what he saw went far beyond anything he had
expected. By the light of a lantern he had unhooked from
the wall <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, having first deposited his precious money-chest
on the floor, was busy raising with infinite caution
one of the paving-stones in the north corner of the cellar.</p>

<p>“Evidently,” the journalist thought to himself, “he wants
to re-bury his treasure in a new place!”</p>

<p>And such was in fact the old reprobate’s intention. In
the hiding place he had opened up he now proceeded carefully
to place the chest; then he replaced the flagstone,
then he scattered sand and dust all round the edges, so
<a id="png.269" href="#png.269"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>269<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that it was soon quite impossible to guess that the stone
had ever been disturbed.</p>

<p>Meantime <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had moved from his spying place;
<span lang="fr">Moche</span> was about to take his departure and he must not
catch sight of the intruder. The journalist’s first idea
was simply to leave the ruined house before the old ruffian;
but on second thoughts he realized that such a mode of
departure was full of risk.</p>

<p>“Once outside, I shall be on the bare, deserted road,
and <span lang="fr">Moche</span> will inevitably see me—and that will never do!”
But now a happy thought struck the young man—<span lang="fr">Moche</span>,
never for one moment suspecting the presence of anyone
spying on his actions, would probably not trouble to search
the rooms. All he himself would have to do would be to
hide, let the old man go out first, then slip away after him
quietly and in perfect safety.</p>

<p>A few minutes more and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, concealed behind a
forgotten pile of firewood, saw <span lang="fr">Moche</span> emerge again from
the cellar. The old fellow crossed the outer room, reached
the door and so away.</p>

<p>“A pleasant journey to you!” grinned <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>.</p>

<p>But the next instant a cold sweat broke out on his brow;
<span lang="fr">Moche</span>, after pulling the door to after him, had locked it
fast.</p>

<p>It was all the young man could do to keep back an
oath: “A prisoner! I am a prisoner, by the lord Harry!”</p>

 ><small>ASSAULT AND BATTERY</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc" lang="fr">Juve</span> was a free man. The <span lang="fr">Juge d’Instruction, M. Fuselier</span>,
who had all along been sceptical as to the generally accepted
theory of the identity of the police-officer with
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, but who had been rudely shaken in his faith
in the detective’s innocence by the startling coincidence of
the wound found on the prisoner’s arm, had bestirred
himself with redoubled zeal and had instituted further
searching investigations. The result had been the discovery
that one of the warders at the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite>, <span lang="fr">Nibet</span> by name,
was in close touch with the <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> gang, and having
access to <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> cell, had presumably seized an opportunity
to drug the prisoner during the night and effect the cut
on his arm that seemed to supply such convincing evidence
of his being the same as the assailant of the unfortunate
inspector of the Criminal Bureau at the Grand Duchess
Alexandra’s ball. Soon the conjecture became a certainty,
albeit <span lang="fr">Nibet</span> had disappeared, alarmed by <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier’s</span>
inquiries, and <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had been released.</p>

<p>He was now closeted with <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> in the latter’s
official room within the <span lang="fr">Palais de Justice</span> and was receiving
the friendly magistrate’s cordial congratulations on the
vindication of his character and his restoration to liberty:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span>, you are free; the fact is established, you are
not <span lang="fr">Fantômas; Nibet</span> is proved the culprit in the matter
of your wound”—and with a spontaneous and charming
affability the magistrate shook <span lang="fr">Juve</span> cordially by the hand.</p>

<p>“But alas!” he proceeded in a less cheerful tone, “we
do not know when we shall be in a position to announce
the capture of another and a more terrible culprit.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> with equal seriousness replied:</p>

<p>“Pooh! I ask you, sir, for a fortnight at the outside!
It is more than a police matter for me now to arrest
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, to unmask him at any rate and force him to
<a id="png.271" href="#png.271"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>271<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fly; it is a personal matter. Remember, all the time I
have been in gaol, I have no doubt my friend, my
<em>accomplice</em>, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, has been at work; I am going now to
see him, and between us <span class="prellips">two </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“Or you three,” corrected <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span>, “for indeed you
must not forget, <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, that you will have an invaluable
helper in the person of Tom Bob.”</p>

<p>But at once the worthy police-officer’s professional pride
was up in arms; at the mention of Tom Bob <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span>
brow contracted and it was in a hard voice that he answered
roughly:</p>

<p>“Tom Bob!<span class="ellips">...</span> well, it strikes me, folks make a deal
of fuss about this Tom Bob, and for my part, <span lang="fr">Monsieur
Fuselier</span>, I am far from desirous of working with <span class="prellips">him </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
<span class="prellips">even </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> stopped short, but the other craved an explanation
of the broken sentence.</p>

<p>“Even what?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Even,” <span lang="fr">Juve</span> resumed, “if I do deal with him, it will
not perhaps be in the way you think, sir!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> started violently.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” he cried, “oh, <span lang="fr">Juve</span><span class="ellips">!...</span> is it possible<span class="ellips">?...</span>
but no, it cannot be! you are mistaken.”
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> gave a dry little laugh:</p>

<p>“I am not mistaken because I am making no assertion,
but this much is certain, that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> this time is not
acting alone. He had accomplices, and accomplices highly
placed. Upon my word! I confess that Tom <span class="prellips">Bob </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But the other sprang up, unwilling to listen to such
extravagant theories.</p>

<p>“Come now, <span lang="fr">Juve</span>,” he remonstrated, “you know the
man yourself, you know Tom Bob personally. You are
aware he is a famous detective, are you not?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> wagged his head as he replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew a Tom Bob; that Tom Bob I esteemed
and admired and I do so still, but, sir, I am speaking of
the Tom Bob who is now in Paris, who is a popular hero,
the Tom Bob who boasts he will run <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> to earth,
and who—mark this, it is an important point, believe me—who
nevertheless never took the trouble to ask permission
to see me at the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite>, when I was supposed to be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!
There are but two alternatives: either the Tom
<a id="png.272" href="#png.272"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>272<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Bob I speak of is my old friend, in which case it was only
natural, I take it, he should have come to offer me the
solace of his sympathy, or he is one of <span class="prellips">the </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> stopped short again then, unwilling to say all he
thought.</p>

<p>“However, time will show,” he said; “anyway, sir, you
may be sure that all my energies from now on will be
devoted to following up my investigations.”</p>

<p>It was getting late. Since early in the afternoon <span lang="fr">Juve</span>
had been discussing with the magistrate the extraordinary
incidents in which <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> name once more figured so
disastrously.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s too late now to sign your discharge paper,
and carry out the lengthy formalities required. So I am
going to give you a provisional form of release and sign
the formal document to-morrow. Will that suit you?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> nodded, and was just opening his mouth to answer
when a knock came at the door, and the magistrate bade
the applicant come in.</p>

<p>It was a working mason who presented himself.</p>

<p>“Give you my excuses,” he said, “but now, sir, can’t
we come into your room to fix up our scaffoldings?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my man, just as you please?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> got up, hastily arranged his papers, locking
away some in drawers, anxious not to leave any compromising
document lying about. He grumbled, “It’s just
killing. Here’s a whole week I’ve never been left in peace
with these building operations for enlarging the <span lang="fr">Palais</span>;
every hour of the day I have workmen fussing around.”</p>

<p>While the magistrate was speaking, in fact, five or six
masons had entered the room. One of these made his
way to the window, in front of which was a hanging scaffolding,
where two more workmen were standing.</p>

<p>“All right, mates?” shouted the mason.</p>

<p>“All right it <span class="prellips">is </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and you?”</p>

<p>“We’re right, too—come on and see!”</p>

<p>And then next moment—the words were evidently a
signal—there followed an abominable scene of violence
and horror.</p>

<p>From the scaffolding two more workmen had jumped
down into <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier’s</span> room. Before they had time to
gather their wits together, the magistrate and <span lang="fr">Juve</span> were
<a id="png.273" href="#png.273"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>273<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>seized by the fellows, bound, gagged, and thrown roughly
to the ground. <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> all but lost consciousness;
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> ground his teeth, fighting desperately, dealing blows
to right and left, a miracle of strength and courage. But
what could he do against the odds? and he was quickly
forced to submit.</p>

<p>“Oh! damn the fellow!” one of the masons swore, “it’s
a blessing we’ve got him tied! Now, sharp’s the word,
my lads! The beak on a chair, and tight up! Hold on
with the tec, eh?” By “the tec,” he meant <span lang="fr">Juve</span>. Two
men were kneeling on his chest, another was holding his
head down on the floor, a fourth was cording his legs.
Dazed and dumbfounded, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> could make nothing of it
all as he watched the bogus masons hurrying to obey the
orders of the one who seemed to be in command.</p>

<p>“The beak on the chair, I tell you!” repeated the chief.
A handkerchief was twisted round <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier’s</span> head,
knotted ropes secured his legs, his hands were tied behind
his back. Then two of the workmen took the unfortunate
magistrate, one by the shoulders, the other by the legs,
and carried him to an armchair. There he was seated
and fixed firmly with ropes. Meantime his mates had
finished tying up <span lang="fr">Juve</span>.</p>

<p>But suddenly the amazing crew who had invaded <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier’s</span> sanctum stopped dead and stood motionless,
afraid to stir. A knock had sounded at the door.</p>

<p>“Curse it!” muttered the “Beadle”—the chief of the
band was in fact, that redoubtable apache—“here’s something
to queer our pitch!” Then, after motioning his
accomplices to gather in a body at the door, he called out
“Come in,” in a quiet voice.</p>

<p>The door opened and the figure of a man appeared on
the threshold; “<span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span><span class="ellipsp">?...</span>” he began: but the
sentence was never finished. At a glance he had seen
<span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> body lying bound and inert on the floor, he had even
caught sight of <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span>, helpless in his chair. Instantly
doubling his fists, a marvel of coolness and courage, he
hurled himself into the room and rushed at the “Beadle”
with a hoarse yell. But behind the door stood massed the
apaches, waiting; he had not taken two steps when a
human swarm was clinging round his shoulders, blows fell
thick and fast, arms and legs were hauled and mauled,
<a id="png.274" href="#png.274"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>274<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he was down, he was choking, he was helpless. Like <span lang="fr">Juve</span>,
like <span lang="fr">Fuselier</span>, in half a minute he was tied and bound,
unable to move a muscle.</p>

<p>“Well, my fine fellow!” the “Beadle” now took up
his parable, “here’s someone I never expected! why the
devil must he come trespassing on our preserves? You
know the chap, eh? <em>You</em> know him, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, don’t you?”</p>

<p>The rest shrugged shoulders contemptuously.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, with his crooked smile, swore: “By God! yes,
there’s no mistaking the beggar, it’s Tom Bob, ain’t it—the
chap that ran in poor ‘Beauty Boy’?”</p>

<p>But the older apache had already resumed his gravity:</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s Tom Bob, the detective! I’m thinking if
we must ‘finish’ him; but no, by the Lord! not worth the
trouble, it ain’t.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the “Beadle” knelt down beside the detective’s
body where it lay and extended on the ground, took
the unfortunate man by the shoulder and shook him roughly:</p>

<p>“Hi! detective, d’ye hear me? Yes? good—now look
and see how we stand, we chaps? You wanted to arrest
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, did you? Well, old man, it’s <em>us</em> have laid hands
on <em>you</em>. And if we don’t finish you off, it’s only to save
worries here. Only, let me give you a bit of advice—by
the next boat you’ll have to hook it back to your own
country. You twig?”</p>

<p>The man got to his feet again, and, a coward like all of
his kidney, while Tom Bob lay helpless and incapable of
offering the smallest resistance, he kicked him in the face
again and again. Presently, tiring of the exercise, he broke
off to add:</p>

<p>“There, I don’t want to spoil your phiz. What’d be
the good of that? But what to do with the beast? we
never looked to see <em>him</em> here. Bah! let’s just tie him
up with the beak, it’ll be company for him!”</p>

<p>But there was no time to waste. It was a good twenty
minutes since the brigands had invaded <span lang="fr">Fuselier’s</span> privacy.
True, at this time of day there was small likelihood of
anybody coming to disturb the <span lang="fr">Juge d’Instruction</span>; still
it was best not to delay—a surprise was after all a possibility
to be feared; a night watchman, a court official, an
usher might arrive at any moment. Like a general inspecting
the dispositions made by his subordinates in command,
<a id="png.275" href="#png.275"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>275<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the “Beadle” proceeded to make a rapid examination of
the fastenings securing <span lang="fr">Fuselier</span> and Tom Bob.</p>

<p>“Righto!” he declared, “they’re hard and fast for the
night, never fear!”</p>

<p>With a grin, he gripped Tom Bob by the shoulders
and dragged him into a dark corner of the room; after
which he seized <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> and turned him round with
his face to the wall:</p>

<p>“They’ll be bored worse than ever if they can’t see one
another! A pleasant time to you, gentlemen<span class="ellips">!...</span> And
the other, ready is he? you’ve got the sack?”</p>

<p>Yes, the other was ready. The chief might gibe and
jest and enliven the proceedings with satirical remarks,
but his men were not wasting their time. While he was
speaking, they had executed the order previously given.
The enterprise, not a doubt of it, had been planned beforehand,
and long beforehand. One of the apaches now unfolded
a voluminous receptacle he had brought with him,
a sort of extra big sack; into this they bundled <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, still
bound, still incapable of the slightest movement. Two
of the ruffians then picked up the sack, and carrying it to
the window, dumped it on the hanging stage.</p>

<p>Finally, after turning the key in the lock to make security
doubly secure, the chief addressed his men:</p>

<p>“Off we go! let’s hook it, mates, all that’s left to do
is to slip down by the scaffold ropes. Underneath we’ll
come on the masons’ workshops. There’s a watchman, of
course, on guard there, but he’s full up at this time of
night; no fear of his waking up. To get the gentleman
away, we’ve the motor-car. Ah! by God! but it’s a fine
bit of work we’ve done this journey!”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">It was three hours or more since the daring ruffians who
had found a way into the <span lang="fr">Palais de Justice</span> had tried and
accomplished their capture of <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, whom they took for
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> was almost despairing. It was all
too abominable; just as he was liberating <span lang="fr">Juve, Juve</span> had
fallen into the brigands’ power. The man was done for
for certain—and so keen was the sympathy the magistrate
felt for the gallant officer, he almost forgot the grotesque
horror of his own position in fear for <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> fate. He
was the more alarmed, inasmuch as, being reduced to
<a id="png.276" href="#png.276"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>276<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>helplessness, <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> realized quite clearly it would be long
ere he was set free, that there was practically no chance
of his being restored to liberty before the next morning
at seven or eight o’clock, the hour when the cleaners of
the <span lang="fr">Palais</span> would want to come in to put his room to rights,
and surprised to find the door locked, would make enquiries
and no doubt find means to enter the room by way of the
window.</p>

<p>Nevertheless <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> was not without some fleeting
gleams of hope. He had perfectly recognized Tom Bob at
the moment the American detective sprang into his room
and had, like himself, fallen a victim to the apaches. He
could not see him, but now and again he heard him move.
Tom Bob had not, like him, been tied on a chair, the
wretches had left him stretched helpless on the carpet.
Perhaps the detective was going to find a way to free himself?
Very certainly it was he who was making those
cracking, creaking noises he could catch at times. It
seemed he must be dragging himself along the floor to try
and break his bonds.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> was not mistaken. Battered and bleeding
as he was, Tom Bob was giving proof of amazing energy.
The apaches once gone, he had managed to crawl up to
the magistrate’s desk, and there, with infinite patience,
being just able to bend his body, he was employed in
chafing against the corner of the desk one of the cords that
held him fast. It needed indomitable perseverance, the
attempt to free himself in this fashion, but Tom Bob had
never wanted for energy. Moreover, the task cost him
agonies, every movement forcing the cords deep into the
flesh, but he was not the man to be deterred by pain.</p>

<p>After prolonged efforts, Tom Bob at last succeeded in
breaking the cord that confined his wrist; after that it
was child’s play to free himself altogether. In a very few
minutes he had released his arms, then his legs, had then
cut off the ropes and snatched out his gag. Barely giving
himself time to inhale a deep draught of air, he hurried to
the unfortunate magistrate’s side and untied him; then,
at the end of his strength, he fell full length on the floor
at his feet.</p>

<p>For many minutes, <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> and Tom Bob, now free,
dared not risk a movement; half stifled both of them,
<a id="png.277" href="#png.277"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>277<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dazed and stupefied, they could only pant for breath.
<span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> was the first to recover his self-possession.</p>

<p>“Ah! Bob! Bob!” he groaned, “what a dreadful thing
has happened to us<span class="ellips">!...</span> <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is surely done for!”</p>

<p>In a hoarse voice, forcing the words with difficulty from
his dry throat, Tom Bob protested:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span>! d’you say <span lang="fr">Juve</span>? But, Monsieur Fuselier, you
are mad! You don’t understand yet<span class="ellips">?...</span> <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is just
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, nonsense! if he was <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> the brigands
would never have pinioned him as they did.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they would, to put you on a false scent.”</p>

<p>“But it was not worth their while, as he was free—I
was going to let him go free.”</p>

<p>“The wretches did not know that.”</p>

<p>“He would have told them.”</p>

<p>“Not before us!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> shook his head emphatically.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he asseverated, “I tell you <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is innocent.”</p>

<p>“And I,” retorted Tom Bob, no less convinced it seemed,
“I tell you the gang, thinking <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, that is to say <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
was definitely unmasked, resolved to deliver their Chief.
They have delivered him and have so delivered him as to
make you think they were treating him with brutal violence,
merely the better to deceive <span class="prellips">you </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span>, suddenly recalling the words <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had
uttered a few hours before concerning Tom Bob, grew
thoughtful and gazed at the detective with eyes of sheer
bewilderment.</p>

 ><small>JUVE HEARS CONFESSIONS</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Hoarse</span>, croaking voices were whispering together:</p>

<p>“Must get to work, half-past <span class="prellips">two </span><span class="ellips">...</span> day’ll be here
<span class="prellips">directly </span><span class="ellips">...</span> hurry up, <span class="prellips">chaps </span><span class="ellips">...</span> to business!”</p>

<p>As he heard the ominous words, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> shuddered, brave
man as he was. The police-officer in the course of his
adventurous life had gone through such ups and downs
of fortune, taken part in such desperate struggles, confronted
such dangers, that he was proof against all contingencies;
yet he could not help trembling, for he felt a
clear and definite presentiment that his last hour was on
the point of striking. The incidents of the evening before
had astounded him, and despite his imperturbable coolness,
the detective could not but shudder to recall the terrible
hours he had lived through since then. In fact, what had
occurred in <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier’s</span> room at the <span lang="fr">Palais</span> and the brutal
fashion in which <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had been kidnapped, overpassed all
limits in the way of fantastic extravagance. Not only had
the gang of scoundrels taken him unawares, thrown themselves
upon him, seized and pinioned him, in the very
<span lang="fr">Palais de Justice</span> itself, but they had actually carried him
off by climbing down the scaffoldings running outside the
windows of the building and got clear away.</p>

<p>Then <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, gagged and bound, unable to stir a finger,
had been pitched into a car which had been driven off at
full speed without the officer being able to gather the faintest
inkling of where he was being taken. Still blindfolded
by a handkerchief tied tight over his eyes, he had been led
into a house, where he had waited in silence and agonizing
suspense to know the decision his abductors would come to
regarding his fate.</p>

<p>As he recalled these events, his mind turned instinctively
on what he had seen last, <span lang="fr">Fuselier</span> attacked and terrorized,
<a id="png.279" href="#png.279"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>279<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the last sound he had heard, the voice of the American
detective, Tom Bob, the man he dreaded and suspected.
Then despair overwhelmed him at the thought of the ever-accumulating
proofs of the persistent ill-fortune that
pursued him.</p>

<p>In truth he was to be pitied! He had been captured
the very day he had at long last regained his freedom,
when, cleared of the dreadful accusations that hung over
his head, he was about to resume the struggle with the
help and co-operation of that mighty organization, that
all-powerful combination, formed by the police and the
Criminal Bureau together. Now, in a moment, as the result
of an odious plot, a plot no man could well have foreseen,
he found himself plunged once more into the dark depths
from which he was just emerging.</p>

<p>All this was assuredly the work of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! This
conclusion <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had definitely arrived at in the course of
the terrible night he had just lived through, the last hours
of which were still slowly dragging out their weary length.
He had clearly seen that, taking advantage of his own long
detention in prison, adroitly profiting by the judicial blunder
to which he owed his incarceration in the <cite lang="fr">Santé</cite>, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
had duped his confederates and persuaded them that <span lang="fr">Juve</span>
was no other than the elusive brigand himself, and that
it was actually <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> who was in gaol. Yes, he understood
the whole scheme now, and from information gathered
here and there, he could guess what was going to happen.
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, the real <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, not content with exploiting
honest people, had exploited the apaches into the bargain—and
these latter were out to take their revenge. With
amazing audacity they had carried off <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, more than
ever convinced that he was <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. And <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, now in
their power, was about to pay the penalty for the grim
brigand’s perfidy.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, the noises the detective heard round
him grew louder and more frequent. Evidently men were
arriving at a <i lang="fr">rendez-vous</i> arranged beforehand, and their
number increased as time went on, while new voices could
be distinguished demanding the immediate opening of the
sitting. Presently <span lang="fr">Juve</span> felt someone was coming up to
him, and the cords that held him fast were loosened and
the bandage removed from his eyes. Mechanically the
<a id="png.280" href="#png.280"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>280<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>prisoner stretched his limbs, cramped by the pressure of
the ligatures.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> found himself stretched on the floor of a square
chamber with bare, white-washed walls. By the light of
a smoky lamp he saw he was surrounded by a score of
apaches, with grim faces and surly, threatening looks.
Some of these were unfamiliar to him, others he knew to
belong to notorious criminals. By the chilly damp that
exuded from the walls and the flagged floor of the place,
as well as by the absence of windows, the detective gathered
that he was confined in the depths of a cellar.</p>

<p>But his reflections were soon cut short. One of the
apaches, the same who had untied him, now kicked a
wooden stool towards him with the order: “Sit there, in
the middle of us, and listen.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> suddenly sprang to his feet. With a desperate,
senseless impulse—for indeed it was useless to dream of
escape—he pushed away the wooden seat, drove back
fiercely with his elbows some of those nearest him, and
darting to the farthest end of the cellar, set his back against
the wall with clenched fists and furious face, ready to offer
a vigorous resistance to the first who should come near
him.</p>

<p>Alas! this spirited show of defiance had no practical
result, rather the contrary. Nobody thought of coming
to grips with the officer. The apaches, seeing him leap
away had first jeered, thinking it a fine joke that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>—for
one and all took <span lang="fr">Juve</span> to be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>—should try
to give them the slip, now it was impossible. But then,
by way of precaution, the men nonchalantly produced their
revolvers, the women borrowed their lovers’ knives and
fell to polishing the keen blades on a corner of their red
aprons.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> never flinched, but stood there impassive, waiting,
though his heart was beating tumultuously. It was
eventually the police-officer’s old acquaintance, the
“Beadle,” who, breaking through the circle gathered
round the prisoner, stepped up to him, mocking and sarcastic,
both hands stuffed insolently in his pockets; the
apache was bent on heaping his scorn on the man he had
looked upon as the “master,” now a captive!</p>

<p>“So there you are, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,” he grinned, “our chief,
<a id="png.281" href="#png.281"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>281<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>our trusty leader! the chap who sets other folks to fight for
him and pockets the tin, and never a stiver for his good
lads!”</p>

<p>“Bravo! bravo, ‘Beadle’!”</p>

<p>With a wave of the hand, the apache silenced his comrades,
signifying he had said nothing of importance yet,
but he was going to begin.<!-- TN: period invisible --></p>

<p>“My lads,” resumed the speaker, turning to his comrades,
who stood listening eagerly, again and again interrupting
his discourse by cries of enthusiastic approval,
“yes, my lads, we may well say we’ve brought off a fine
bit of business!”</p>

<p>“True for you,” suddenly shouted the “Gasman,” “and
it’s lucky we had cute chaps with us like the ‘Beadle’”—and
another burst of applause greeted the words.</p>

<p>All this while <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had not stirred or opened his lips;
nerves and attention on the stretch, he had listened, understood,
realized the appalling position he had to face. Meanwhile
the “Beadle” resumed, emphasizing the facts, that
were plain enough as they stood.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,” he apostrophized the prisoner, “you’re a
cute devil, I don’t dispute that, but we are cuter than
you, seeing as how we’ve caught you. Well, I’m going
straight to the point, I am: here’s how it stands—<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
must shell out or croak! so look sharp and make up
your mind, and tell us where the money is; you’ve got five
minutes to answer, after that five minutes is up your
silence will be your death warrant!”</p>

<p>To occupy his mind, to cheat his despair, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> began to
count mechanically, as if in a dream; there were left him,
he told himself, three hundred seconds to live, after that
he would face the final plunge, exchange time for eternity.
Would they kill him at a stroke, or must he endure some
of those dreadful tortures the apaches invent to satisfy
their thirst for vengeance? <span lang="fr">Juve</span> refused to think of it,
that his courage might not fail him before the end.</p>

<p>Amid the deafening uproar that raged round him, the
apaches were discussing, all clamouring at once, the sort
of death <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> deserved. <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, forcing himself to go
on counting so as not to hear, continued speaking almost
out loud:</p>

<p>“Hundred and <span class="prellips">twenty-five </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span class="prellips">hundred and twenty-six </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
<a id="png.282" href="#png.282"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>282<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hundred and <span class="prellips">twenty-seven </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and <span class="prellips">twenty-eight </span><span class="ellips">...</span>
<span class="prellips">twenty-nine </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>” his voice never <span class="prellips">shook </span><span class="ellips">...</span> “hundred and
<span class="prellips">thirty </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>” he stopped dead. A mysterious voice had
whispered in his ear, “<span lang="fr">Juve! Juve!</span>”</p>

<p>The detective did not start; he stood quite still, his
back against the wall; where did the voice come from? he
could not tell. All round him crowded the apaches, some
actually hustling him with their shoulders, others crouching
about his feet.</p>

<p>Meantime he felt someone trying to slip in between him
and the wall, to hide himself behind his back. Inspired
with fresh courage, he seconded the attempt, taking a
short step forward towards the middle of the room.</p>

<p>The voice went on: “Don’t turn round, <span class="prellips" lang="fr">Juve </span><span class="ellips">...</span> and
answer, for the love of God answer, tell them you are going
to pay!”</p>

<p>Ah! that voice! and the tone and the words! <span lang="fr">Juve</span> felt
a sudden return to life and hope! his heart still beat as if
it would burst his bosom, but his mind experienced a
prodigious relief. He guessed it was a friend come to save
him, and one he could count on even more surely than on
himself. He had recognized the voice of his old comrade
<span lang="fr">Jérôme Fandor!—Fandor</span> of whom he had had no tidings
for six months, of whom he had heard nothing, of whose
very existence he had no assurance, since the day of their
unexpected parting.</p>

<p>How came he to be there—just at the critical moment,
at the risk no doubt of his own life, clearly with the sole
intention of rescuing his friend from this most desperate
of plights? Had <span lang="fr">Juve</span> been cognizant of late events and
known of the eight and forty hours <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had passed as
a prisoner in the house at <span lang="fr">Alfort</span> up to the time when the
apaches had brought thither his fellow officer, he would not
have needed to ask himself the question.</p>

<p>But neither did <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> deem the moment come for
explanations. His compelling voice still urged <span lang="fr">Juve</span> to
answer.</p>

<p>“Tell them—‘I am going to pay’”—and <span lang="fr">Juve</span> obeyed
his mentor. Cutting short the “Beadle,” who in ferocious
triumph was counting out aloud the seconds left him to
live—“Only <span class="prellips">twenty-five </span><span class="ellips">...</span> only <span class="prellips">twenty-four </span><span class="ellips">...</span> only
twenty-three,” <span lang="fr">Juve</span> cried out suddenly, instantly grasping
<a id="png.283" href="#png.283"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>283<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the part he must play, assuming a tone and attitude of
dignity and high authority:</p>

<p>“Listen, you fellows; <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is going to pay you!”</p>

<p>Bravos broke out on every side, and the ruffianly crowd,
forgetting their rancour, now felt full of sympathy for the
master who manifested so praiseworthy an intention. But
next minute, this outburst of satisfaction was succeeded
by a resumption of sour and suspicious looks.</p>

<p>“No humbug, eh?” muttered one.</p>

<p>“We’ve been done once before!” objected another.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,” declared a third, “you will not leave this
place before you’ve paid up!”—and to a popular air, the
whole assemblage began to growl out the refrain:</p>

<p><span class="prellips">“Money </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span class="prellips">money </span><span class="ellips">...</span> money!”</p>

<p>But now, high above the hoarse-voiced, monotonous
chant, there suddenly rang out like a peacock’s scream a
shrill, screeching voice, demanding:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, tell us where you have put the stuff?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> was losing his first fine confidence, and though to
some extent reassured by the presence of his invisible ally,
he began to fear he could not keep up the bold front he
had shown so far. What was he to answer now?</p>

<p>Fortunately <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> voice again whispered words of
counsel, and <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, listening with one ear to what his trusty
comrade was saying, brought out in broken jerks:</p>

<p>“The <span class="prellips">money </span><span class="ellips">...</span> my <span class="prellips">lads </span><span class="ellips">...</span> it’s not far off, it’s
<span class="prellips">here </span><span class="ellips">...</span> here in this very place, under the stone flags
that pave the cellar floor.”</p>

<p>The announcement was received with shrugs of incredulous
derision and <span class="nw">cries of</span></p>

<p>“You’re humbugging us!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span>, greatly perplexed, yet obeying implicitly the instructions
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> continued to whisper, went on:</p>

<p>“Stop your gab, you fools! Am I the master, or am
I not?”</p>

<p>The rough, masterful words had their effect; a silence
followed and <span lang="fr">Juve</span> little by little entered into the very
spirit of the part he was enacting literally impromptu.
For sure, if ever <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had found himself face to face
with his numerous accomplices, it would have been just
so he would have talked to them.</p>

<p>The “Beadle,” rather chagrined to see his prestige
<a id="png.284" href="#png.284"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>284<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>diminishing, challenged the individual he took to be
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>:</p>

<p>“Show us then where it is, take up the flags yourself!”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Juve</span> stopped him with a gesture full of an impressive
dignity.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,” he cried, still prompted by his admirable
coadjutor <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> scorns to work with his own
hands, it is to you, you dogs, belongs the task of digging
up the treasure you are going to divide amongst you.”</p>

<p>“Proud beast!” growled the “Beadle.”</p>

<p>But less sensitive, the rest of the apaches did not need
twice telling; they were quite ready to obey the orders
of the master whose high authority imposed itself upon
them in spite of everything. “Bull’s-eye” and the “Gasman”
sprang forward and had soon raised the two first flags—to
find nothing underneath save sand. But taking advantage
of the confused uproar that ensued, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> prompted
again:</p>

<p>“Tell them to go on, tell them to raise the third stone,
and you are saved!”</p>

<p>The detective gave the order <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> suggested. The
two apaches raised the last flag—and started back in sheer
terror! An atrocious spectacle lay beneath their eyes,
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> himself, who had stepped forward to see, stood there
transfixed with horror. The third stone covered a black
hole in the ground in which lay a corpse half devoured by
the worms! The flesh showed the greenish hues of decomposition
and exhaled a poisonous stench. The chest had
fallen in, a mass of shattered bones and disintegrated,
putrefying flesh, and from its midst gleamed the white,
polished handle of a metal money-chest. Where the dead
man’s heart should have been a strongbox had been deposited.
It was there the master had concealed the money
destined for his confederates—a ghastly hiding place, a
hideous repository!</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span>, who understood nothing and dared not so much
as turn around to question <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> with a look, yet retained
his coolness. Henceforth an impassive spectator of the
appalling scene, he stood waiting to become, when his
friend should give the word, one of the heroes of the new
scene that was now to be staged.</p>

<p>Again <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> prompted, and again <span lang="fr">Juve</span> gave the order:</p>

<p><a id="png.285" href="#png.285"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>285<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Whoever of you is not afraid, let him go take the
treasure from the depths of the ‘tomb.’”</p>

<p>The apaches gave a roar, but stood hesitating. All were
bending over the gaping grave. Their eyes glittered with
covetousness; their grinning faces worked spasmodically
in mingled repugnance and desire; their hooked fingers
twitched with eagerness to seize the shining handle of the
treasure chest, the metal lid of which winked in the wavering
light of the smoky lamps that supplied the only illumination
in the gloomy cellar. But none dared to move;
the apaches were afraid—for the first time!</p>

<p>But now the throng grouped round the hideous hole
was pushed aside and an old woman, her face scarlet, her
breath coming in gasps, advanced with arms akimbo to
the edge of the grave.</p>

<p>“Why, what,” she croaked, “what’s amiss with you, you
chaps? to be scared of a dead man, for shame! Well, I’m
only a woman, I am, but I’m out to show you cowards
what pluck means. True as I stand here, this hand I hold
up is going to dive into the fellow’s guts and fetch out his
gold heart!”</p>

<p>Her hearers shuddered as she carried out her gruesome
purpose, remarking with a hideous laugh: “Why should
I be scared of the good man? we’re old acquaintances, we
<span class="prellips">are </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I was the one packed him in down there!”</p>

<p>Meantime the old harridan had deposited the strongbox
at the feet of the man she too supposed to be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.
Whereupon the apaches quickly found their tongues again
and all bawling at once, demanded their fees in payment
of the crimes they had committed. All that remained in
fact was to open the little chest. The key was in the lock
and an eager and obliging volunteer in the person of
“Bull’s-eye” came forward; the lid was raised and a mass
of gold coins revealed.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, more and more well pleased with the turn events
were taking, had whispered to <span lang="fr">Juve</span>:</p>

<p>“Let them share out the swag!”</p>

<p>But the journalist said no more, assailed by a new
anxiety, for <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had taken the game into his own hands
and was preparing to speak.</p>

<p>“By the Lord!” thought <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, “what is he going to
say? How risky, pray God he won’t make a hash of it!”</p>

<p><a id="png.286" href="#png.286"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>286<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><span lang="fr">Juve</span> had drawn up his tall figure to its full height and
with a sweep of the arm pushed away the apaches crowding
round him; with a sudden jerk of the knee he upset “Bull’s-eye”—this
was his thanks for the man’s zeal in opening
the chest—reclosed the strong box and planted his foot
on the lid.</p>

<p>“Not so fast,” he cried, “hear me first, you chaps! The
money is there, and it’s good money; you can rest assured
of that, but first of all, do as I tell you. Everyone shall
be paid, each according to his deserts; you have worked
for <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, and <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> means to reward you in proportion
to what you’ve done! Go on, my lads, and every
man tot up his accounts: the bravest will come off the
best. Let’s sit down!”</p>

<p>A round of applause approved the officer’s announcement.
Yes, he was right, those who had done nothing
much did not deserve much pay, the cute ’uns who had
worked hard should get the richest prizes.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> marshalled his men in a circle round him, and
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, reassured as to his comrade’s fate, slipped away
and mingled unobtrusively with the crowd. A majestic
figure, with flashing eye and commanding pose, the ex-detective
played to perfection the rôle of the grim, mysterious
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. The man’s coolness was amazing, for did
he not confront the possible risk that at any moment the
true owner of that redoubtable name might appear before
him? He went on:</p>

<p>“I am listening, out with it all! give in your claims, my
lads; every man shall have his deserts!”</p>

<p>But to begin with a protest was voiced by all present.
Nothing was to be paid away to the absent, the cowards,
the shirkers, who had not dared to come—and by this they
meant <span lang="fr">Moche, Père Moche</span>, the gang’s confidential agent,
the man who no doubt had engineered the scheme to entrap
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, but who from now on seemed of no more use
and inspired only feelings of hostility.</p>

<p>Why yes, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> saw no objection to sacrificing the old
reprobate. “<span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>,” he cried, “shall get nothing,
that I swear.”</p>

<p>Another burst of acclamation; then in the pause that
followed, seven or eight voices were raised.</p>

<p>“It was us,” they declared, “kidnapped the Minister,
<a id="png.287" href="#png.287"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>287<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>by your order, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>; you remember, it was a devil
of a job, we had to be mighty smart<span class="ellipsp">!...</span>”</p>

<p>Calmly, impassively, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> drew a memorandum slip
from his pocket, “Your names?” he questioned coldly.</p>

<p>One by one, the apaches filed past the officer, giving
in their names and their nicknames.</p>

<p>The “Gasman” made a halt before his superior: “It
was me,” he said, “set afire the beggars’ refuge, while you
were getting ’em aboard your car.”</p>

<p>“Well and good!” pronounced <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, “<span class="ellips">...</span> and you?”
he proceeded, turning now to the “Beadle.”</p>

<p>“You know yourself, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, you know what I did.”</p>

<p>“That goes for nothing; say it over!”</p>

<p>“What’s the good?”</p>

<p>But murmurs of discontent broke out; why must the
“Beadle” give himself these airs? all he’d got to do
was to state his case like the rest; else he’d get nothing
at all!</p>

<p>“Well,” he let out reluctantly, “it was me did the trick
about the Princess Sonia’s <span class="prellips">jewels </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>But “Bull’s-eye” broke in furiously.</p>

<p>“And what about me, ‘Beadle’?” he growled, “didn’t
I see you at work—with your hands in your pockets? I
was in that business, too!”</p>

<p>Imperturbably <span lang="fr">Juve</span> noted down on his slip three significant
memoranda: “Jewels, the ‘Beadle,’ ‘Bull’s-eye.’”</p>

<p>“Next,” he called—and two women, “Big Ernestine”
and another virago known as the “Panther,” insisted on
the master’s hearing them.</p>

<p>“It was us,” they clamoured, “flooded the lake with petroleum,
so as you could light up the blaze.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span>, however, had a question to put. Would he get
an answer? he hardly dared expect it. Still he ventured
to ask:</p>

<p>“And the big things, eh? the Minister of Justice, who
killed the Minister of Justice?”</p>

<p>But at this everyone burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Devilish funny,” they grinned; “none of your jokes
on us, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! everybody knows it was you.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> took heedful note of the information; yes, the crime
should be set down to the account of the real culprit. He
went on with his questions:</p>

<p><a id="png.288" href="#png.288"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>288<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“And the bank collector? who did the murder of the
<span lang="fr">Rue Saint-Fargeau</span>?”</p>

<p>A chorus of voices answered him: “<!-- TN: original has opening single quote --><span lang="fr">Moche</span>, it was <span lang="fr">Père
Moche</span>.”</p>

<p>But one voice protested; someone had sprung lightly
over the gaping grave and stood before <span lang="fr">Juve</span>. It was
<span lang="fr">Paulet</span>. The young apache with the light eyes and pallid
complexion growled out:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Moche</span> never did anything but make his profit out of
the crime; he robbed me of the money, as he’s robbed me
of my wench, to marry her to the rich Englishman; but
as God’s above me, I swear it was I, <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, all on my own,
who did in the bank messenger!”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” rose the answering cry; “bravo! it’s you,
<span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, for the big prize!”</p>

<p>But now mother <span lang="fr">Toulouche</span>, the hag who had hauled out
the strongbox from the half decomposed corpse, emerged
from the dark corner where she had been crouching ever
since.</p>

<p>“And for me,” she vociferated in her screaming voice,
“why don’t they question me? ask me what I’m good for?
Well, I’m going to tell you, whether or no. Hear me,
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, and you, mates, too. The man who lies rotting
there, down there in the fat, damp earth, the man who
lies rotting there, bone naked, uncoffined, well, that’s my
work, mine! <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,” she persisted, “it was me did
the hardest job of all. By <span lang="fr">Père Moche’s</span> orders, I sought
out this man on the open sea aboard the liner <cite lang="fr">La Lorraine</cite>.
I boarded the big ship when the tug brought out her pilot
to them; slipping on deck when no one was looking, I crept
down to the fellow’s cabin. I had no weapon, and I was
only an old woman against a man in the prime of life.
Well, I was a match for him all the same; I sprang at his
face, and with my bare teeth I tore out his throat! To
stop his blood fouling the carpet, I licked it up with my
tongue. The man fell dead without a cry. Then I sewed
him up in a big sack, and when we got near port, I pitched
him into the water. Next night, with <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> to help,
we fished up the body, poking about with a long pole in
the mud at bottom of the dock-basin. And for three days
did I cart the carrion about, till I buried it with my own
hands under the flags in this cave here! That’s what I did,
<a id="png.289" href="#png.289"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>289<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, I, a poor old woman; say, have I the guts, am I
brave, or am I not?”</p>

<p>Without the quiver of a muscle, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> had listened to
the appalling confession of the hideous virago.</p>

<p>“This dead man,” he asked in a low, broken voice, “who
was he?”</p>

<p>But suddenly there rose an urgent cry of “Hush! hush!”
The apaches had heard unusual sounds, the tramp of footsteps
in the distance. By the wan, feeble light that filtered
in through a grated opening on a level with the ground outside,
the crowd could see one another’s repulsive faces drawn
with anxiety. Already half suppressed vows of vengeance
began to be heard. <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was terrified; what was to
happen next? Was <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, after escaping the gravest of his
dangers, finally to fall a victim to <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> fury? Was it
he, the real <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, that was coming?</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Juve</span> with superb audacity, an admirable effrontery,
commanded:</p>

<p>“Silence, all of you, and don’t budge! if it is <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
alone they are after, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> will defend himself alone,
if it is all of us they are looking for, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> will be at
your head to defend you and triumph over our enemies;
hush, do not speak, do not stir!”</p>

<p>Slowly <span lang="fr">Juve</span> pushed through the throng and made for
the door of the cellar. He tried to open it; it was locked
fast!</p>

<p>“The key,” he demanded. The “Beadle” advanced
grumbling: “Here it is,” he said, “what to do now?”</p>

<p>“Open,” ordered the inspector.</p>

<p>“You are leaving us, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?” he was asked.</p>

<p>“I am keeping guard over you,” replied <span lang="fr">Juve</span> boldly.</p>

<p>Then he left the cellar, but did not go away. Between
him and the apaches now stood the heavy door secured by
an outside bolt the officer had shot with his own hands.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> stood there listening; a posse of men was surrounding
the house.</p>

 ><small>JUVE’S BAG</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">An</span> hour or so before these events, while it was still night,
the police-officers on duty at the head <span lang="fr">Commissariat</span> office
at <span lang="fr">Alfort</span> were roused from the peaceful doze they were
indulging in by the unexpected arrival of an individual
who seemed breathless and exhausted as if he had been
running a great distance.</p>

<p>“The Commissary?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The sergeant shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You may be very sure he’s not here.”</p>

<p>“And his deputy?”</p>

<p>“He’s away too, of course.”</p>

<p>“Who is in command here then?”</p>

<p>The sergeant indicated himself.</p>

<p>“Well, if you must know, I am; who are you? what do
you want?”</p>

<p>Curtly, in measured tones, the man explained:</p>

<p>“Who am I! I am Tom Bob, American detective,
specially known of late days at the Prefecture of Police
and in the city for his war against <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded and saluted; he had heard tell of
Tom Bob and recognized the foreign police-officer from
the numerous descriptions and portraits he had read and
seen of him.</p>

<p>“What can I do to serve you?” he asked.</p>

<p>Tom Bob told him: “You can arrest <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span><span class="ellips">!...</span>
at this moment he is close by with his gang of apaches
round him; they are all gathered, he and his confederates,
in a deserted house, at the far end of the military road,
right hand side after the second cross-roads.”</p>

<p>“I can see the shanty from here,” announced the sergeant,
“a wretched hovel it is; but who is it tells <span class="prellips">us </span><span class="ellipsp">...?</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has "..?" -->

<p>Tom Bob informed him curtly:</p>

<p><a id="png.291" href="#png.291"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>291<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“<em>I</em> tell you, that is sufficient<span class="ellips">!...</span> how many men have
you?”</p>

<p>“Eight.”</p>

<p>“That’s not enough.”</p>

<p>The sergeant was getting alarmed: “I can ask for more
from the <span lang="fr">Charenton</span> office!”</p>

<p>“That’s the thing.”</p>

<p>The sergeant got into communication by telephone with
his colleague at the neighbouring police post.</p>

<p>“There are fifteen over yonder,” he informed Tom
Bob.</p>

<p>“They must all come,” declared the detective, “<span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span>
band counts at least a round dozen ruffians.”</p>

<p>The detective’s requirements were transmitted from the
<span lang="fr">Alfort</span> office, and the fifteen <span lang="fr">Charenton</span> officers promised to
be there in a quarter of an hour. The gallant sergeant
was greatly excited by the coming events; to avoid all
doubt and make sure he was covered by his superiors,
he asked:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Bob, shall you be coming with us?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly!” replied the American detective. But
the sergeant was not satisfied yet.</p>

<p>“I have a great mind,” he announced, “to go and inform
the Commissary, he lives close by.”</p>

<p>“You should have done that long ago!” Tom Bob said
rebukingly.</p>

<p>Then, while the sergeant was issuing his orders, the
detective sat down in the public office, lit a cigarette, and
did not vouchsafe another word.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">Before coming thus rudely to disturb the peace and
quietness of the <span lang="fr">Alfort Commissariat</span>, Tom Bob had been
wandering up and down most part of the night in perplexity.
On quitting the <span lang="fr">Palais de Justice</span>, leaving <span lang="fr">Fuselier</span> to make
the best of his absurd plight, that ambiguous individual
had realized one fact quite clearly, viz., that the magistrate
had looked at him in a way that was decidedly disquieting.
An extraordinary thing for him, Tom Bob’s face had
blanched somewhat under the magistrate’s questioning look,
but he quickly recovered his customary coolness. Stepping
out on to the <span lang="fr">Boulevard du Palais</span>, quite empty and deserted
at this late hour, he hailed a passing taxi and offered the
<a id="png.292" href="#png.292"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>292<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>driver a handsome tip to drive him as far as the first houses
of <span lang="fr">Alfort</span>.</p>

<p>There the detective quitted his conveyance and plunged
into the darkness of the silent lanes of the sleeping village.
He entered a deserted house; and strange to say, a few
moments later, it was not Tom Bob who reappeared, but
<span lang="fr">Père Moche—Moche</span> with his wig, his spectacles, his big
nose, as soft and flabby as an indiarubber ball, and his red
whiskers. It was <span lang="fr">Moche</span> who was now making his way
slowly and deliberately towards the building where two
days before he had gone to bury the strong box containing
his money and where, without his knowing it, he had imprisoned
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span> when he double locked the door behind
him on his departure. It was <span lang="fr">Moche</span> who, hidden near by,
watched his friends the apaches one after another approach
the house to which he knew that <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, mistaken for <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
had been brought. It was <span lang="fr">Moche</span> who, as time went
by and he sat watching how matters were going, fell to
rubbing his hands in self-congratulation.</p>

<p>“No need,” he thought to himself, “to go myself; I
should only be risking the same fate as <span lang="fr">Juve</span>. Now, what
is happening<span class="ellips">?...</span> it is three o’clock in the morning, <span lang="fr">Juve</span>
is on his defence at this very moment, they are demanding
their pay, and he cannot give it them<span class="ellips">;...</span> I know my
fine fellows—in ten minutes my sweet friend, the police-inspector,
will be put to death, doomed as a <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> at
once traitor and perjurer!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> rose and set off at a run for the more central
parts of the city. Suddenly he snatched away his wig and
spectacles, pulled off his false nose and red whiskers—and,
extraordinary to relate, instead of the old usurer’s ill-omened
face appeared the keen, refined countenance of the American
Tom Bob. In a ringing voice the latter cried in defiance
of men and gods:</p>

<p>“Good-bye, old <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, good-bye, Tom Bob, I thank
you both for lending me your fascinating personalities and
enabling me thus to triumph over my opponents. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
my boy, you’ve worked to some purpose!”</p>

<p>Could anyone have overheard this extraordinary soliloquy,
he would assuredly have been struck with sheer amazement,
for if at a pinch sundry persons <em>had</em> come to suppose
that <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> bore so close an affinity with <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
<a id="png.293" href="#png.293"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>293<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that possibly he was <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> himself, none could ever
think that the detective, who had come to France under
official sanction with the express object of hunting down the
brigand, was in fact none other than that same notorious,
ever evasive criminal, now better assured than ever against
capture, seeing he was actually giving chase to himself.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> stood, a solitary figure in the far-stretching
plain, thinking.</p>

<p>“I cannot rest satisfied,” he muttered, “till I see <span lang="fr">Juve</span>
lying dead—as dead as a man can be! I must also,” he
went on, “for a few hours more keep up my rôle of Tom
Bob; I shall score yet another success if by one triumphant
cast of the net I contrive that the French police shall arrest
the whole gang of my <span class="prellips">confederates </span><span class="ellips">...</span> I should say
<span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> confederates!”</p>

<p>Then it was that, calculating his time almost to a minute,
the atrocious scoundrel had given the alarm at the <span lang="fr">Alfort</span>
police-post.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">Dawn was breaking fast. The officers from <span lang="fr">Charenton</span>
had joined the <span lang="fr">Alfort</span> contingent and the united force was
hurrying, Tom Bob and the Commissary at their head,
towards the extremity of the military road where the
mysterious house stood. The sergeant was issuing his
instructions.</p>

<p>“You will surround the building,” he ordered his men;
“you will draw in the circle more and more, but taking
cover to avoid accidents; have your revolvers out, the
brigands lurking there are terrible fellows; at the first
suspicious movement, fire without a moment’s hesitation.”</p>

<p>Meantime Tom Bob, quite unruffled, was explaining to
the Commissary:</p>

<p>“You know what happened yesterday—<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> released
from prison, carried off by the apaches, tried by
the villains, doomed and perhaps executed<span class="ellipsp">?...</span>”</p>

<p>But Tom Bob broke off short with a cry of terror. On
the threshold of the ill-omened house, at the opening of
the stairs giving entrance to the cellar, stood a man motionless,
with folded arms.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!” exclaimed Tom Bob. But the Commissary
set him right at once.</p>

<p>“No, no! it is <span lang="fr">Juve</span>,” he cried, “<span lang="fr">Juve</span>! Yes, we heard
<a id="png.294" href="#png.294"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>294<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>aright; the papers that gave the news yesterday spoke
the truth, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is innocent and a free man”—and the
Commissary sprang forward towards the Inspector of the
Criminal Bureau.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve, Juve</span>,” he questioned, “what are you doing here?
What are you waiting for?”</p>

<p>The officer replied deliberately, in a quiet voice, perfectly
calm and collected:</p>

<p>“Why, my dear Commissary, it was <em>you</em> I was waiting
for!”</p>

<p>“The brigands,” went on the official excitedly, “<span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span>
accomplices—where are they?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> pointed a finger at the door against which he leant.</p>

<p>“They are there,” he said, “inside there; it only remains
for us to have them out one by one; how many men have
you with you?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-three,” the Commissary informed him.</p>

<p>After thinking a moment, “Yes, that is sufficient,” <span lang="fr">Juve</span>
declared, “we can get to work.”</p>

<p>The Commissary, a worthy fellow, once a subordinate
under the friendly Inspector at the Criminal Bureau, could
not refrain, despite the critical conditions of the moment,
from expressing his delight.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span>, my dear <span lang="fr">Juve</span>,” he cried, “what a blessed thing!
Your innocence is acknowledged at last; I am so glad, so
very glad<span class="ellipsp">!...</span>”</p>

<p>But the good man never finished his congratulations.
For some minutes ominous sounds had been heard coming
from the cellar, and now a fearful yell broke out and a
hailstorm of bullets, fired at point blank range from inside,
pitted and pierced the door, fortunately a thick, heavy
one. Nevertheless <span lang="fr">Juve</span> was struck by two or three projectiles,
spent balls luckily, otherwise the inspector would
have been shot dead. He stepped back a pace or two.</p>

<p>“That spoils our game!” he muttered simply, “I suppose
our fine fellows have found out at last that the <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
they held prisoner was no other than <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, the police-officer!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” demanded the Commissary, consulting the
Inspector with enhanced respect in face of the new danger,
“how must we proceed now?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> cast a rapid glance round the house. “We must
<a id="png.295" href="#png.295"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>295<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>parley with them to begin with,” he declared—and in a
voice he made big and authoritative, he challenged the
apaches.</p>

<p>“You are taken!” he announced in peremptory tones,
“surrender!”</p>

<p>The shouts redoubled, mingled with oaths of the most
appalling profanity. The Commissary, all for making a
quick end, suggested:</p>

<p>“For my part, I should make no bones about shooting
them all down through the grated windows, if five minutes
from now they haven’t given in their submission.”<!-- TN: closing quote invisible --></p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Juve</span> was biting his lip, a prey to excruciating
anxiety. At all costs firing must be avoided, the ruffians
induced to surrender and a fight prevented; doubtless
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> did not care a straw for the lives of the monsters who
had come so near killing him, but he knew that among
them was one, the least hair of whose head was sacred to
him! But would the apaches give in, or must they be
mastered by force or famine? Either solution was equally
repugnant to <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, always swayed by the same motive.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a crowd of the honest, hard-working inhabitants
of <span lang="fr">Alfort</span>, risen early as is their wont, had gathered
round, naturally all agog with curiosity to see this quite
unusual display of police activity round the old building
that had always borne something of an evil reputation.
The police, on being questioned, had not hesitated to say
it was a matter of a gang of dangerous apaches they had
just brought to bay. The louder the clamour of oaths
and threats that rose from the cellar, the more excited and
angry and impatient grew the crowd.</p>

<p>“Smoke ’em out!” rose the cry, and fists were shaken
fiercely at the wild beasts’ lair, as they remembered how
in all the honest, hard-working population of <span lang="fr">Alfort</span> there
was hardly a soul but had suffered from the depredations
and atrocities of the ill-omened gang, or at any rate, of
similar gangs of <span class="prellips">marauders </span><span class="ellips">...</span> They had them at their
mercy, why not make an end? Already, in spite of the
constables’ efforts to keep order, the crowd was kindling
round the walls dry vine shoots and wisps of straw: through
the low grated window someone threw in a lighted brand.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> began to tremble, and once more addressed the
apaches:</p>

<p><a id="png.296" href="#png.296"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>296<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Come now, don’t go trying to be too clever; surrender,
I tell you!”</p>

<p>Then the “Beadle” spoke out in the name of all. In
a quavering voice, a coward in face of the instant danger,
the fellow whined:</p>

<p>“We’re going to give in, <span lang="fr">Juve</span>; only protect us from the
crowd, those dogs might easy tear us to pieces.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> made no show of insolent triumph. At a nod from
him to the Commissary, a double line of officers, revolvers
in hand, formed up either side of the entrance, while four
men stood ready in the doorway to clap on the bracelets
as the ruffians came out. A minute or two earlier the
Commissary had caught sight of an army forage-wagon
going by, and had requisitioned it to serve as an impromptu
“Black Maria” for the conveyance of the sinister crew
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> had so opportunely arrested.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> held the heavy door of the cellar ajar. “One by
one!” he ordered—and the apaches obeyed. “Bull’s-eye”
was the first to present himself, wearing a hang-dog
look and offering his wrists docilely for the handcuffs to
be adjusted; behind him appeared “Big Ernestine,” with
hard-featured face and rouged cheeks, casting black looks
of furious defiance at the crowd that jeered at the street-walker<!-- TN: hyphen invisible -->
and her tattered finery; next came the “Gasman’s”
turn, a tall skeleton with enormous hands; then the
“Beadle,” shivering with fear; <span lang="fr">Paulet</span>, paler than ever,
his features drawn and distorted almost beyond recognition
in sheer terror of the scaffold; then <span lang="fr">Mère Toulouche</span>, alone
and utterly callous, who the moment she was outside, began
to harangue <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, the police-officers, the Commissary,
chuckling and grinning in hideous mockery.</p>

<p>All submitted to the same fate with a remarkable docility.
But when the officers prepared to deal with the last of
the unfortunates issuing from the cellar in this ignominious
fashion and were going to slip on the bracelets, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> threw
himself impetuously before them.</p>

<p>“No, oh no!” he cried, “not that one, you shall not
pinion him! leave him to me, I will see to him; for, look
you, this is the man who saved my life, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>!”—and
to the amazement of all, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> fell into one
another’s arms in a long-drawn embrace.</p>

<p>For Tom Bob, he had vanished long before this!</p>

 ><small>THE DECOY</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">It</span> was broad daylight by this time and the morning, still
a trifle chilly, gave promise of a very fine day. The tragic
scenes just enacted had had, thanks to the radiant beams
of the rising sun, an almost cheerful setting. As the forage-wagon,
now transformed into a “Black Maria,” was driving
off, loaded up with the sinister crew so opportunely captured
by <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, the latter rubbed his hands, a customary mark
of inward satisfaction with that officer.</p>

<p>“Good work <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>!” he said—“and none too soon,
neither! I was beginning to despair.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> wagged his head sententiously.</p>

<p>“We should never despair, <span lang="fr">Juve</span>; but all the same, like
you, I confess this morning has held some surprise for us.
I was just eating my heart out down in that cellar; I
thought one time neither you nor I would ever see the
light of day again<span class="ellipsp">!...</span>”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Juve</span> was lost in a brown study. With head cast
down and hands clasped behind his back, he paced a few
steps in the direction taken by the army vehicle carrying
the gang of apaches.</p>

<p>“We are going to the police-station?” <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> asked.</p>

<p>“To the station? no! We have something better to
do.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> stood with folded arms, fixing a look of interrogation
on his companion’s face.</p>

<p>“You are leaving all those fellows in the lurch?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“I am not leaving them in the lurch, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>! We shall
catch up with them again before long; now at once, if
need be. Only we have more pressing business. Never
forget, my boy, that all those fellows are really and truly
only supers. What we want now is to come upon the
leading actor.”</p>

<p><a id="png.298" href="#png.298"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>298<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> smiled: “The leader, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, eh? But I
take it, <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, that now, like me, you are no longer in
ignorance who it is? <span lang="fr">Moche</span> strikes <span class="prellips">me </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> laughed too, a hearty laugh of triumph. After the
terrible hours the gallant inspector had spent in his prison,
after the depressing times he had known when everybody
accused him of being <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, he was at last nearing the
final victory, the rehabilitation of his character, the arrest
of the real culprits! It was in fact barely a few hours since
<span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span> and his colleagues had recognized the fact that
he was really <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, and yet with marvellous skill and coolness,
owing more to his own amazing boldness than to circumstances,
he had succeeded in wresting the mask from a
gang of the most dangerous criminals, accomplices of the
ever-elusive arch-criminal himself; nay more, he had pushed
his investigations so far that the actual identity of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
hardly admitted of further doubt for him, that he could
feel confident the arrest of the <cite>Lord of Terror</cite> was now only
a question of hours.</p>

<p>Taking <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> by the shoulder, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> spoke softly:</p>

<p>“Egad! yes, I know who <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> is! I even know
twice over who he is!”</p>

<p>“Twice over? <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand me, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>? Come now, you
accuse <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, don’t you? You do this, by reason of the
part he played with these apaches? and you are in the
right. But there’s more to follow. For <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> to be
<span lang="fr">Moche</span> was not enough; that travesty held good only for
his confederates. <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, to dupe all Paris as he did,
believe me, was someone else into the bargain, someone
I suspect, astounding as the thing may sound. And it is
of this suspicion, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, we must now establish strict,
undoubted, undisputable proof.”</p>

<p>Dumb with amazement at the cool confidence of the
man, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> demanded in a stammering voice:</p>

<p>“Whom do you suspect then, <span lang="fr">Juve</span>? have you a scheme
of investigation?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> nodded his head gravely.</p>

<p>“I have more,” he declared: “I have a fear.”</p>

<p>“What do you fear?”</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten the corpse you showed me just
now?”</p>

<p><a id="png.299" href="#png.299"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>299<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> started back in sudden agitation.</p>

<p>“What!” he gasped, “if I am to believe you, you already
think you <span class="prellips">know </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>“The name of the dead man? Yes, by my faith! I do.
Come with me.”</p>

<p>The two men re-entered the ill-omened ruin where they
had spent such tragic, such hopeless hours of agony. It
was not without a shudder <span lang="fr">Juve</span> gazed round the damp,
confined cellar where, but for <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> quite unlooked for
intervention, he would inevitably have met an appalling
death.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Fandor</span>!” began his friend, “it is a hideous job we
have to do. It is the grave there must give us up its secret.
The unhappy man who lies in it, <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> unsuspected
victim, must rise up to accuse his murderer!”</p>

<p>The journalist was livid. A gruesome task indeed, this
work of justice <span lang="fr">Juve</span> proposed to undertake! For one who
had so lately borne such torments of fear and suspense, it
called for nerves of steel, an extraordinary strength of
will, to confront afresh the dismal horrors of the exhumation
he was bent on. The intrepid officer stepped up to
the grim hiding-place, which a few hours before the hideous
hag, <span lang="fr">Mère Toulouche</span>, had not feared to ransack in search
of gold—gold <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had buried there, and of which
she claimed her share, boasting she had a better right to
it than anyone.</p>

<p>Then, in the gloom of the cellar, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> bent
over the gaping hole. A blast of pestilential gases struck
them full in the face, the ignoble horror of what they saw
forced them to recoil. Instinctively the two took hands,
panic-stricken, yet resolved to prove their courage, to
manifest at all costs that they had the right, the duty to
break once again the repose of the dead man, who lay there
in his unhallowed grave. The spectacle was appalling.
The fleshless face, in which the eye orbits were two hideous
holes, and the hanging jaw mimicked a dreadful grin,
seemed to stare up at them with sightless orbs.</p>

<p>Bending low, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, speechless, motionless,
shuddering, anxiously scrutinized the unrecognizable features.
Who was the unknown, this victim of <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span>
villainy? After what grim drama had the corpse been laid
in this secret grave, where once again his rest was to be
<a id="png.300" href="#png.300"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>300<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>disturbed, where <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had not feared to deposit his
treasure for safe keeping.</p>

<p>“The dead man is unrecognizable,” pronounced <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>,
“it is impossible to know who and what he was. <span lang="fr">Bertillon</span>
perhaps, by his scientific methods, might <span class="prellips">discover </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period follwed by ellipsis -->

<p>But <span lang="fr">Juve</span> interrupted the journalist with a rapid gesture,
his agitation waxing greater every moment. While the
other was speaking, he had leant still closer over the grave
and was examining the body with yet keener attention.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Bertillon</span>, say you? <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, we have no need of him
and his system. I can guess the dead man’s name! This
is what I hoped—the dead man speaks, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, the dead
man denounces the impostor. The corpse we have before
our eyes—why hesitate to say it, our conclusion will be
confirmed by the <span lang="fr">Toulouche</span> woman when we question
her—is Tom Bob’s, the unfortunate American detective
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had them murder directly he knew of his arrival
in France—yes, Tom Bob’s, the real Tom Bob; for the
Tom Bob everybody has known for months, the Tom Bob
who was afraid to meet me, the Tom Bob who was seen
at the Grand Duchess Alexandra’s, the Tom Bob who only
yesterday made pretence of struggling with the men who
kidnapped me, you surely know <em>his</em> true name by now?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, stunned by his friend’s assertions, durst hardly
articulate the name of terror, “<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!” Indeed the
journalist had good right to be terrified—and overjoyed
too! If <span lang="fr">Juve</span> was correct, if he was not deceiving himself,
the triumph they were winning over <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> was even
more complete, more brilliant than they had ever hoped for.</p>

<p>But the journalist was not convinced. Too many improbabilities
seemed to him to forbid Tom Bob’s being
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, too many impossibilities rose in his memory to
suffer him, unprotesting, to listen to <span lang="fr">Juve’s</span> assertions.</p>

<p>“I tell you, <span lang="fr">Juve</span>,” he brought out at last, “I cannot
believe you; Tom Bob can<em>not</em> be <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, the thing is
impossible!”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Juve</span> remained unmoved by the other’s scepticism.
“And why not, pray?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Remember the messages despatched from the <cite lang="fr">Lorraine</cite><span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, the messages despatched by the real
Tom Bob—the real Tom Bob whom nobody recognized in
<a id="png.301" href="#png.301"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>301<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the train, because he had been replaced by the sham—the
sham Tom Bob, who, being in fact <span lang="fr">Moche</span>, knew the
‘Beauty Boy’ would be there, marked down his man and
had the police arrest the apache—all the time a hundred
miles away from recognizing his denouncer.”</p>

<p>“But then, remember the attempted assassination at the
<span lang="fr">Hôtel Terminus</span>; Tom Bob, the man you accuse, might
well, like me, have lost his life <span class="prellips">there </span><span class="ellips">...</span> <span class="prellips">so </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> smiled. “Silly boy!” he laughed, “why, don’t you
understand that this attempt, so miraculously frustrated,
had all been planned by Tom Bob himself? My precious
innocent, why, that was just the very best way of avoiding
any chance of his being suspected. Look you, I wager,
if we inquire, we shall find the occupant who preceded Tom
was <span lang="fr">Moche</span>—that is to say himself!”</p>

<p>But again <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> objected: “I grant your explanation
on this point; but here’s another thing—if Tom Bob is
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, why did he have the body of the bank messenger
he had murdered brought to light?”</p>

<p>“Why, for the same reason, to impress people with his
cleverness, my dear sir<span class="ellips">....</span> But what are you laughing
for?”</p>

<p>“Because,” returned the journalist, “I’ve kept my best
argument for the last. Remember <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> telephoned,
before witnesses, to Tom Bob<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>But <span lang="fr">Juve</span> knew better than to attach much weight to this
last objection of <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span>. The latter was very evidently
convinced, if he could find no stronger argument than this
to bring against his friend’s theory.</p>

<p>“And do you remember this, my friend—how, a few days
ago, they found in a garret at the <span lang="fr">Hôtel Terminus</span> a phonograph,
the roll missing, hitched on to the telephone wires.
After that, what else can you think of to say? or do you
admit that Tom Bob is <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> nodded, vastly impressed.</p>

<p>“I admit this, <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, that you are now and always the
king of detectives; and yet, there <em>is</em> a doubt still lingers
in my mind”—and pointing to the corpse; “Look here,”
he persisted, “you say this is truly and indeed Tom Bob’s
body—how do you know that?”</p>

<p>“By the finger”—and he drew <span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> attention to
the dead hand. One of the bones of the forefinger piercing
<a id="png.302" href="#png.302"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>302<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>through the discoloured flesh hung down, with an uncanny,
almost threatening gesture. The bone of the finger was
slightly crushed and crooked.</p>

<p>“Mark that,” said <span lang="fr">Juve</span>. “In old days, once when I
was working with Tom Bob, without knowing him at all
well indeed, in the course of an investigation we were
pursuing amongst certain anarchist associations, this unlucky
Tom Bob came very near being killed by a bomb.
Fortunately the explosion was not so violent as the assassins
had expected. Still Tom Bob was severely hurt; his
right hand was hit, and this finger damaged. The injury
is therefore an unmistakable pointer, a bit of evidence that
cannot be challenged. Egad! sir, it will be easy enough for
us to cable to the American Criminal Department and get
the precise details from the descriptive ticket certifying
Tom Bob’s identity. It is only a question of hours; by
this evening the dead man will have definitely avowed his
name; by this evening, I tell you, we can be sure of having
discovered the unfortunate Tom Bob, the real Tom
Bob.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> was already on his feet. Less inured than <span lang="fr">Juve</span>
to the sight of death, he felt an instinctive longing to get
back to the light of day, to be gone from this noisome cellar
that had been turned into a sepulchre.</p>

<p>“And now, <span lang="fr">Juve</span>,” he asked, “now, by your showing,
what is best to do?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> had likewise risen. Casting a last look at the corpse:</p>

<p>“Sleep in peace,” he murmured, “sleep in peace, you shall
be avenged!”</p>

<p>Then, turning to <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>: “Now?” cried <span lang="fr">Juve</span> in his
clear, ringing voice, “now? Now, it is only left us for one
time more to risk our lives! We must make all speed—you
can guess to whose house, I imagine? and with what
object<span class="ellips">?...</span> My lad, the hour is come at last when <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
is to settle up accounts with us!”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fandor</span> involuntarily turned pale. Oh! that decisive
moment <span lang="fr">Juve</span> announced, with what anxiety he had been
waiting for it all these long months! that moment they
were now to know! What a joyful triumph they would
both enjoy to grip <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> by the collar, the ever elusive
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>! The journalist could hardly credit the reality;
he asked:</p>

<p><a id="png.303" href="#png.303"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>303<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“<span lang="fr">Juve! Juve!</span> then we are going to arrest him, him
the never-to-be-captured?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> shrugged his shoulders, smiling, almost unmoved.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “we are going to arrest <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!
But can you guess, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, where we are going to arrest
him?”</p>

<p>“Not I!”</p>

<p>“For sure, you are losing your wits! Come, think!
Tom Bob, at this present moment, must know we are hot
on the scent and be thinking of disappearing. Now, is he
the man simply to disappear without reaping the profits of
his crimes?”</p>

<p>“Why, no!”</p>

<p>“Then, my dear man, all we have to do is to go to the
grand duchess’s, to Lady Beltham’s, to seek the organizer
of the famous subscription. It is heavy odds, don’t you
see? that Tom Bob, before disappearing, will want to get
hold of the moneys collected for his benefit. The strong-box
where they are locked up, that is the decoy, the bait,
that is bound to attract him powerfully; it is beside it we
must take him in our toils.”</p>

<p>“Or shoot him down like a noxious wild beast,” concluded
<span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, brandishing his Browning.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns"><span lang="fr">M. Landais</span>, Minister of Justice, was that morning at
nine o’clock clad in a very summary costume. Wearing a
long dressing-gown, gaping open over his chest, his naked
feet thrust into a pair of slippers, unshaven, and only half
awake, he was seated on his desk in his official rooms in
the <span lang="fr">Rue Franklin</span>; he held his telephone receiver in one
hand, he was driving his secretaries frantic with a hundred
contradictory orders, while at the same time worrying the
unfortunate girl on duty at the Exchange out of her life.</p>

<p>“Hello!” called the Minister, “I’m asking you to put
me through to the Prefecture. The Prefecture of Police?
Yes! that’s plain enough, surely; <em>can’t</em> you understand?”</p>

<p>Then he dropped the receiver, and swearing out loud a
terrific oath, he yelled, as if to somebody behind the scenes:</p>

<p>“But, hell and damnation! the thing’s outrageous!
<span lang="fr">Havard</span> has not been told about it! Else he’d be here!”</p>

<p>“You must remember, sir,” observed a valet, who at

<p>“Well, he had only to get up, eh? <em>I</em>’ve got up, haven’t
I<span class="ellipsp">?...</span>”</p>

<p>But the Minister stopped abruptly; he had just got
connection with the Prefecture of Police:</p>

<p>“Hello!” he called, “well, what news<span class="ellips">?...</span> What<span class="ellips">?...</span>
What’s that you tell me? <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is dead? Good Lord! you
are simply mad<span class="ellips">!...</span> You don’t know? They never do
know anything at the Prefecture! We must make a change
there!”</p>

<p>Trembling with agitation, he hung up the receiver
again and, all alone in the room, began a perplexed
soliloquy:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span> is dead! <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is dead! That isn’t true, for I was
awakened by a message informing me that he was tied up
at the <span lang="fr">Palais de Justice</span>, along with <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span>! But in
that <span class="prellips">case </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped to listen; there was a knock at the
door of his room.</p>

<p>“What now?” he yelled, “what is it<span class="ellips">?...</span> Come in, come
in!”</p>

<p>The same valet who had just before answered <span lang="fr">M. Landais’</span>
summons, again put in his head.</p>

<p>“It is a cyclist constable who would <span class="prellips">like </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>“Tell him to come in, for God’s sake!”</p>

<p>The manservant vanished, far from anxious to enjoy a
prolonged <span lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span> with his master, who was in the vilest
of tempers. A second or two more and a police-officer
entered the Minister’s working room. He had no time to
stare in astonishment at the great man’s unconventional
attire; the Minister was down on him instantly:</p>

<p>“Why, what is it now? Where d’you come from?”</p>

<p>The officer saluted respectfully.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he was beginning, “I’ve come from the Commissary’s
office at <span lang="fr">Alfort</span><span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p> 

<p>“From <span lang="fr">Alfort? Alfort</span>, what the devil’s up at <span lang="fr">Alfort</span>?
What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Sir,<!-- TN: comma invisible -->” the man persisted, “they have just captured a
dozen <span class="prellips">brigands </span><span class="ellips">...</span> a dozen accomplices of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>.”</p>

<p>“Who has captured them?”</p>

<p>“Inspector <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, sir.”</p>

<p><a id="png.305" href="#png.305"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>305<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The Minister stood hesitating a moment. “<span lang="fr">Juve</span>?” he said
at last. “But that’s impossible; <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is dead!”</p>

<p>Losing all sense of the respect due to a superior, the
officer, overwhelmed by the news, asked excitedly:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span> dead? is <span lang="fr">Juve</span> dead?”</p>

<p>But, paying no heed to the worthy policeman’s emotion,
the Minister proceeded:</p>

<p>“Or he is tied up in the <span lang="fr">Palais de Justice</span>, since yesterday
evening<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>“Tied up in the <span lang="fr">Palais de Justice</span><span class="ellips">?...</span> since yesterday
evening?” stammered the officer, opening eyes of sheer
amazement.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Landais</span> completed the man’s mystification.</p>

<p>“Certainly!” he affirmed. “He is tied up, because he is
set at liberty! You can make nothing of it, my man?
No more can I<span class="ellips">!...</span> And that’s about enough! Clear
out!”</p>

<p>The officer swung round on his heels as if to leave the
room; then, dead set on delivering his message, he repeated:</p>

<p>“Well, sir! <span lang="fr">Juve</span> may be dead, or he may be tied up,
or he may be at large; anyway this much is certain, he
has just arrested twelve apaches!”</p>

<p>And so saying, while <span lang="fr">M. Landais</span> sprang to his instrument
and began to ring up the Exchange again with
frantic energy, the officer took himself off. Hardly was
the door closed behind him before the manservant half
opened it again cautiously:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre</span>!”</p>

<p>“Go away! I’m telephoning<span class="ellips">....</span> Hello! Hello! put
me through to the <span lang="fr">Palais de Justice</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre</span>!” repeated the servant.</p>

<p>“What is it, in God’s name!”</p>

<p>“It’s a lady crying in the anteroom; she says she <em>must</em>
speak to you?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Landais</span> looked up: “A lady? what’s her name?”</p>

<p>“I did not quite<!-- TN: original reads "qute" --> catch her name, sir, but it’s a princess,
sir, it seems—the Princess <span class="prellips">Sonia </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis -->

<p>“Sonia Danidoff<span class="ellips">?...</span> What does <em>she</em> want now? Show
her in.”</p>

<p>But at that same moment the room door burst open
with startling violence. It was Sonia Danidoff, who, beside
<a id="png.306" href="#png.306"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>306<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>herself with excitement, had forced her way, despite the
secretaries’ objurgations, into the Minister’s private room.
The unhappy woman was holding to her forehead a handkerchief,
the muslin and lace of which were dyed red.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre</span>!” cried Sonia, in a voice choked
by emotion, “they wouldn’t hear me at the Prefecture!
Nobody would listen to a word! Make them do me justice.
Look, I have just been the victim of a dreadful assault!
The Grand Duchess Alexandra has disfigured me!”</p>

<p>Sonia Danidoff was exaggerating. With a tragic gesture
she took the handkerchief from her forehead. On the pearly
surface of the temple a cut was bleeding.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said the Minister, who knew Sonia Danidoff
very well, “it is the <span lang="fr">Commissariat</span> you must apply at!”</p>

<p>“No, <span lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre</span>! They would not understand
at the police office the importance of my wound. If I
have come to you, it is to denounce an abominable piece
of swindling! The Grand Duchess Alexandra, the organizer
of the subscription for <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> benefit, is Tom
Bob’s mistress! And it was on account of jealousy, because
Tom Bob is my lover, that she flew at me.”</p>

<p>For once the Minister quite forgot the courtesy due to a
lady.</p>

<p>“The Grand Duchess Alexandra is Tom Bob’s mistress?”
he cried. “Why, what fresh complication have we here?
And what do you want me to do?”</p>

<p>The door opened yet again, and <span lang="fr">M. Landais’</span> private
secretary came in, a very fashionable young man, very
elegantly dressed and immaculately turned out.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he informed the Minister quietly, “here is a fresh
communication come from the <span lang="fr">Palais</span>.”</p>

<p>“What do they say?”</p>

<p>“It was not <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, it was Tom Bob, who was tied up
last night with <span lang="fr">M. Fuselier</span>.”</p>

<p>But Sonia Danidoff, hearing this, broke in, protesting:</p>

<p>“Tom Bob tied up? What next! I have this moment
run away from him; he was at the Grand Duchess Alexandra’s!
he is there now!”</p>

<p>“Tom Bob is at the Grand Duchess Alexandra’s?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Landais</span> sprang to his feet once more; he clapped
both hands to his head and vociferated in tones of desperation:</p>

<p><a id="png.307" href="#png.307"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>307<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Oh! I am going mad! I am going mad! They are all
dead! they are all tied up! they are all free and at large!
and there are twelve apaches arrested and the Grand
Duchess Alexandra is Tom Bob’s mistress. Don’t, don’t!
it is too much! let me be, give me a moment’s peace!”</p>

<p>Once more the door opened. Calm, cool, collected, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> entered the room.</p>

<p>“You sent for me, sir?” he asked. “Whatever is going
on? I can’t see one of your secretaries, the doors stand
open for anyone to walk into your working room. Your
trusty servant even refuses to show me in, simply telling
me to march straight into your private room! Is it a revolution?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">M. Landais</span> cut short <span lang="fr">M. Havard’s</span> exclamations:</p>

<p>“A revolution? I can’t say! It’s just a story for a
madhouse—the Grand Duchess Alexandra is a swindler!
<span lang="fr">Juve</span> is dead! <span lang="fr">Juve</span> has arrested a dozen apaches! Tom
Bob is tied up at the <span lang="fr">Palais</span>! Tom Bob is running away!
he’s free and at large: he’s at the grand duchess’s! I tell
you I’ve lost count of everything. I don’t understand one
word of it all!”</p>

<p>But seeing <span lang="fr">M. Havard’s</span> amazed look as he listened to
the Minister’s wild words, the latter realized he would do
well to cultivate a little more calm of manner.</p>

<p>“Listen, <span lang="fr">Havard</span>,” he said, “I have really lost touch with
things. Since waking this morning I have received twenty
contradictory reports. It will be another dreadful panic in
town unless we can clear all this up”—and the Minister
told <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span> the story of his morning as intelligibly as
he found possible. All the time he was speaking, the Head
of the Criminal Bureau listened quietly, nodding his head
at intervals in silent assent. Where the Minister was all
at sea, he, <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, accustomed to matters of police,
could make a shrewd guess at the truth, and it was in an
unruffled voice that the police official finally proposed:</p>

<p>“If you think well, sir, I am going straight away to Lady
Beltham’s?”</p>

<p>“To Lady Beltham’s?”</p>

<p>“Well, the Grand Duchess Alexandra’s, if you like it
better.”</p>

<p>“But what for?”</p>

<p>“To beg her—and Tom Bob, who is with her, by what
<a id="png.308" href="#png.308"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>308<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the Princess Sonia stated—to come and make their deposition
before you, and before <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, who, I am persuaded, will
not be long now in letting us hear of him.”</p>

<p>For the Minister <span lang="fr">M. Havard’s</span> words were incomprehensible.
Still he was too well assured of the ability invariably
displayed by the Head of the Criminal Department not to
agree to his plan.</p>

<p>“Go by all means, <span lang="fr">Monsieur Havard</span>; but tell me, is it
an arrest you are going to attempt?”</p>

<p>“No, <span lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre</span>, it is an invitation I am going
to proffer, <em>but</em> I shall be accompanied by a dozen constables
when I make it.”</p>

 ><small>THE “EVER-EVASIVE” ESCAPES AGAIN</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">The</span> Grand Duchess Alexandra gave vent to an exclamation
expressive both of surprise and triumph, as she greeted
the visitor who stood before her. The latter, dropping his
eyes and assuming a humble, almost abject mien, the
bearing of a repentant sinner, murmured:</p>

<p>“I am happy, madam, to return your greeting.”</p>

<p>The grand duchess seemed sceptical; with panting breath,
for she was greatly agitated, she questioned:</p>

<p>“Tell me, sir! tell me, Tom Bob, what fresh crisis, what
pressing necessity obliges you to come to me like this?”</p>

<p>Tom Bob, for he it was, hesitated a moment before
replying. Slowly he lifted his glance and fixed it on the
grand duchess’s face. The lovely creature and the wily
detective looked long into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p>The grand duchess<span class="ellips">?...</span> Tom Bob? In truth, there
was no need for play-acting between these two, they were
by themselves, alone, without witnesses. They could avow
to one another who they really were—she, Lady Beltham,
the mysterious, the redoubtable mistress of the most abominable
brigand in all the earth; he, that same brigand,
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!</p>

<p>And now the tragic lovers, after a hundred changes of
fortune, intentional or accidental, that had hindered their
meeting, found themselves face to face and under untoward
circumstances that forced them to exchange terrible,
bitter speeches; for these two felt for one another at once
an atrocious hate and an ineradicable love! Yes, in very
deed, those two beings who were perpetually at daggers
drawn, who had ever between them the most appalling
episodes, the most fearful deeds and memories, were straitly
bound one to the other by an unbreakable chain of love,
whose links were riveted by the strongest of all implements,
the crimes they had committed together.</p>

<p><a id="png.310" href="#png.310"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>310<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>It was in the drawing room of the mansion where dwelt
the great lady who for all the world was the Grand Duchess
Alexandra, but in reality was no other than Lady Beltham,
that the painful interview took place.</p>

<p>“What have you come here for? what do you want?”
demanded the lady; but <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, in a hollow voice he endeavoured
to make cold and peremptory, but which only the
more betrayed his anguish, only replied by another question.</p>

<p>“Sonia Danidoff,” he asked, “what has happened to
Sonia Danidoff?”</p>

<p>The brigand—he too was breathless with emotion—felt
he <em>must</em> know the truth, his heart as a lover laid an obligation
on him, an obligation that wounded his self-love,
anxiously to question the mistress he had forsaken as to the
fate which she, in her jealous rage, had reserved for the
other who had now become the favourite. Lady Beltham
fought hard against her agitation and the pain that tore
her breast; she articulated in a voice that whistled between
the clenched teeth:</p>

<p>“Sonia Danidoff! I wanted to kill her!”</p>

<p>Instinctively <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> doubled his fists and cast a look
of menace at the speaker; he would have hurled himself
upon his defiant mistress, but the latter with an air of
sardonic insolence stood before him, a superb figure of
defiance, and never flinched. Yes, she defied her lover;
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> dared not go near her; yet curiosity, the craving
to know what had become of Sonia, compelled him to hide
his anger.</p>

<p>“What have you done with her? Where is she? Speak!”</p>

<p>Breathing all her hate in a dolorous cry, Lady Beltham
wrung her beautiful hands, and groaning aloud, cried:</p>

<p>“Go, Tom Bob, go and ask the officers of justice, go
and learn from the police the fate I have reserved for your
mistress, and the opinion she now has of you!”</p>

<p>“Of me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, of you!”</p>

<p>It was the brigand’s turn now to tremble with apprehension,
but such was the empire he possessed over himself,
he was able to hide his agitation under a mask of smiling
irony.</p>

<p>“Lady Beltham,” he asked quietly, “so you have told
the princess who I am, have you?”</p>

<p><a id="png.311" href="#png.311"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>311<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Very certainly, Lady Beltham had not gone so far as
this, for despite her jealousy, she still cherished for the
outlaw one of those monstrous passions that are like consuming
fires devouring women’s hearts, fires that are only
extinguished by death! Nevertheless the jealous woman
suffered her lover to believe that during a scene of angry
altercation she had revealed to her rival the ignominy, the
baseness, the crimes of the man whom the too trustful
Sonia Danidoff had thought well to choose as the object of
her heart’s desire.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> bit his lips and his eyes fell, while Lady
Beltham demanded in a questioning, defiant tone:</p>

<p>“And why should I not have told the princess who you
were?”</p>

<p>Receiving no answer, she proceeded, smiling in her
turn with a show of scornful dignity:</p>

<p>“You are afraid, it seems, that knowing you in your
true aspect, she might cease to feel for you the fatal infatuation
that consumes her? Poor princess! poor pitiful
passion<span class="ellips">!...</span> what matter the faults, the vices of the
man a woman loves, when she truly loves him? <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,”
the sobs were rising to her lips as she went on, “I ask you,
have your villainies, have your crimes silenced in me the
fond feelings I entertain for you? Have I, for all the
hideous life of blood and terror I live because of you, have
I ceased to love you?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> broke in:</p>

<p>“You profess to love me, madam, to love me still, and
yet you harass me with your threats<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>Lady Beltham interrupted in her turn:<!-- TN: original has semicolon --></p>

<p>“Hate, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, is it not another form of love?”</p>

<p>But the outlaw shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he declared, “I have lost all confidence;
trusting to appearances, you have doubted my loyalty—I
have proof of it, I know it; perhaps your distrustful
attitude has gone for much in that I have shown towards
you<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Lady Beltham, “have
you not, many times over, tried to kill me? Remember,
<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, the evening of the <span lang="fr">Pré Catalan</span><!-- TN: hyphen removed for consistency -->!”</p>

<p>“You were there, madam, and I knew it; but recollect
how, by an accident contrived by me, your car could not
<a id="png.312" href="#png.312"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>312<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be started, a circumstance which saved you from the
accident in the lake.”</p>

<p>“Say rather,” protested Lady Beltham, shuddering, “that
hitch, that breakdown, seemingly providential, enabled you
to start back alone and unhindered with the Princess Sonia
Danidoff.”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> shrugged as he avowed with a cynical grin:</p>

<p>“Little I cared for her love, it was her jewels I was after;
you see I have nothing to hide from you!”</p>

<p>“Scoundrel! ruffian!” screamed Lady Beltham, “so that
is the alternative you offer me—to find my satisfaction in
your thievish instincts to appease the horrid jealousy that
stabs my heart. No, it must end, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, a life like
this is become impossible, you must make your choice;
choose betwixt us two, the princess and me. I do not mince
my words: I bid you think of the consequences!”</p>

<p>A flash of rage flamed in <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> eye, but to-day the
pirate, the outlaw had clearly no chance left to show himself,
as usual, the master, the tyrant, the despot, who
commands, and all men obey! He must condescend to
parley, and in a choked voice he muttered:</p>

<p>“Let us leave that for the moment, Lady Beltham,
let us leave it; more serious events are brewing, are imminent!”</p>

<p>The great lady laughed sardonically.</p>

<p>“Why, yes!” she sneered, “I don’t doubt that, if you
are here, it is <span class="prellips">evidently </span><span class="ellipsp">...</span>”</p><!-- TN: original has period follwed by ellipsis -->

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> cut her short.</p>

<p>“Lady Beltham,” he assured her, “our plans have been
frustrated, the scheme I had built up is crumbling to
pieces; since yesterday <span lang="fr">Juve</span> has been free and triumphant<span class="ellipsp">....</span>”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span>!” cried Lady Beltham, thunderstruck, “is it possible?”</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> nodded in confirmation.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span>!” reiterated his agonized mistress, “why, then it
is the same existence of anguish and fear and never ending
alarms will begin again, but worse than ever.”</p>

<p>“Yes, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> is at large,” insisted <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>. Then he
added; “But as you were saying just now, Lady Beltham,
I think it must all end—yes, and soon?”</p>

<p>“What do you propose then?”</p>

<p><a id="png.313" href="#png.313"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>313<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Lady Beltham stopped suddenly. The bell of the
house telephone that communicated with the porter’s
lodge had just rung. Mechanically the great lady
unhooked the receiver and listened. She was going
to say no! to the question asked by the servant speaking
from the other end of the wire, but <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, without
the smallest scruple, had appropriated the second
receiver.</p>

<p>“Ask him up, madam,” he gave his orders, “you cannot
do otherwise, you must!”</p>

<p>Lady Beltham obeyed and gave the required answer to
the servant:</p>

<p>“Ask <span lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Ascott kindly to come upstairs; show
him into my rooms.”</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">In the midst of that Parisian oasis formed by the <span lang="fr">Parc
des Princes</span>, Lady Beltham had for some months been in
occupation, under the name of the Grand Duchess Alexandra,
of a magnificent mansion standing in the middle of
a vast park. The front of the house was approached by
great gates of wrought iron, dividing the boulevard from
a fine gravelled drive that swept round a lawn before the
main entrance. Behind the building was a short cut leading
from the offices and opening into a deserted by-street; this
could only be reached after crossing an orchard planted with
fruit trees, a spot of quite a countrified and unpretending
aspect. The path connecting the house with the exit into
the by-street was completely overshadowed by a double
row of clipped yews, a relic of a garden of an earlier date,
and throughout its length were ranged a number of beehives,
giving this part of the garden a homely and utilitarian
appearance, a charm that was at once restful and picturesque.</p>

<p>While Lady Beltham was awaiting the visitor whom, at
<span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> unexpected order, she had decided to receive,
and was endeavouring to restore to her features, distorted
by the agitations she had gone through, some appearance
of calm and composure, the monstrous malefactor, who had
for months duped all Paris, passing himself off as the
American detective, Tom Bob, slipped away softly into the
adjoining room, under pretext of an intention to listen to
the conversation the wealthy young Englishman wished to
<a id="png.314" href="#png.314"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>314<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>have with the lady he doubtless still took to be the Grand
Duchess Alexandra.</p>

<p>But anyone who could have seen <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> when alone
in the room would surely have suspected the man of some
more sinister motive. The brigand did not stay near the
half open door, shielded though it was by a heavy curtain.
With preoccupied air and a brow wrinkled in anxious
thought, he stepped up to the window, and long and carefully
scrutinized what lay outside, if by any chance he
might espy under the shadow of the trees some suspicious
figure, some symptom of unknown danger.</p>

<p>Ascott was shown in by a footman to the grand duchess’s
apartments. The Englishman appeared, his features drawn
with anxiety, his limbs twitching in uncontrollable excitement.
With a hurried bow, he sank into a chair.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, madam,” he stammered; then going straight
to the point, he asked:</p>

<p>“Tom Bob is here, is he not? Oh! I beseech you, tell
me; I <em>must</em> see him.”</p>

<p>So agitated was the young man he never noticed the look
of terror his words brought to his hostess’s face. Hearing
it said that Tom Bob was with her, she all but fainted, but
recovering her self-possession:</p>

<p>“Who told you that?” she demanded: “What do you want
with him?”</p>

<p>Then, without waiting for an answer, she questioned further:</p>

<p>“But tell me, what has happened to you?”</p>

<p>Ascott faltered in broken words that betrayed his confusion
of mind:</p>

<p>“A calamity, madam, an appalling calamity has befallen
me and still crushes me.”</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a crumpled telegram, the tears
welling to his eyes:</p>

<p>“Read, madam,” he cried, and could not articulate another
word.</p>

<p>Lady Beltham glanced through the message; it announced
that, in a motor-car accident, Ascott’s father, the
well-known peer and member of the Upper House, and his
son, the young man’s eldest brother, had been killed! The
tragedy had occurred in Scotland, in the Highlands, without
a soul in sight!</p>

<p><a id="png.315" href="#png.315"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>315<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Ascott was sobbing bitterly. “When I heard of this
terrible blow, madam,” he declared, “I had a presentiment,
nay, all but a certainty, that the death of my loved ones
was not due to mere accident. For, I must tell you this,
I am the victim of a hideous plot, a prey to the most
poignant anxieties. Madam,” he went on with an effort,
“I was married quite lately, as you know<span class="ellips">....</span> I married
an ‘unfortunate,’ an abandoned creature<span class="ellips">....</span> I am the
victim of <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> villainies, who showed himself to me
under the repulsive guise of the old usurer known by the
name of <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span>. The monster of superhuman guile
has me in his toils, which he draws tighter and tighter
every day! The wife he made me marry has run away,
she has robbed me, ruined me; but that is nothing, would
be nothing at all, did I not guess that my father’s death
and my brother’s must be yet another outcome of a plot
contrived by <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>Lady Beltham was in a better position than anybody
to realize that the rich Englishman must be right; assuredly,
the further she went, the more she would hear set
down to her baleful lover’s account the most appalling
revelations.</p>

<p>Ascott, harking back to his first idea, again demanded an
answer to his question, adjuring her to tell him where
Tom Bob was.</p>

<p>“I <em>must</em> see him,” he urged, “I must see him and speak
to him. Tom Bob is the only person on earth, madam,
who by his perspicacity, his adroitness, his admirable detective
skill, can extricate me from my difficulties, and put
me in a position to avenge my relatives’ deaths. Tom
Bob, madam, is the man who must fight <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>!”</p>

<p>Lady Beltham was like to die of distress and perplexity.
No doubt, she had but to open a door to bring the young
Englishman face to face with the bogus detective. But
was it her duty to act so? Ought she not rather to enlighten
Ascott, to tell him that <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> and Tom Bob were one
and the same, just as <span lang="fr">Père Moche</span> and <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> again
were one single and identical person! This course was
what her conscience bade her take. But would duty triumph
over love?</p>

<p>Mechanically, moving like an automaton, without knowing
yet what decision she would adopt, for, if she felt pity
<a id="png.316" href="#png.316"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>316<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for Ascott, she burned with an ardent love for <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,
the great lady advanced slowly into the room where the
brigand was. But next instant, horrified, she sprang back,
though not without having first double locked the door of
communication.</p>

<p>What she had seen must have been something to cause
both terror and despair, for Lady Beltham turned deadly
pale, her splendid arms beat the air, she staggered and fell
flat on the floor in a dead swoon. The look she had
directed into the adjoining room and which had, in fact,
determined her fainting fit, had passed unnoticed by the
unfortunate young Englishman, too much preoccupied and
agitated to observe the details of what was happening before
his eyes. But now, seeing Lady Beltham’s condition, he
hurried to her side and endeavoured to restore her to consciousness.
His efforts proved vain, and shocked and
alarmed, he rang the bell in the anteroom and called
loudly for help.</p>

<p>Servants appeared in answer to his summons; Lady
Beltham was laid on a couch and restoratives applied. In
ten minutes, by slow degrees, the unhappy woman began
to regain her senses.</p>

<p>But suddenly the tense silence was broken by the sound
of shots. Lady Beltham shuddered and grew paler than
ever.</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” she asked, “what is happening?”</p>

<p>Ascott could not tell her; the servants gathered about
their mistress stood rooted to the spot in dumb bewilderment.</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns"><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, when he left Lady Beltham waiting to receive
Ascott, had his plan already cut and dried. The desperate
villain realized that the game was up, beyond redemption.
Unmasked so far as <span lang="fr">Moche</span> was concerned, he was no less
so in his incarnation as Tom Bob—but only in the minds
of <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, of <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, and of Lady Beltham.</p>

<p>For one brief instant the criminal had debated with
himself what course was best to adopt. The moment was
surely near at hand when he must either take to flight and
disappear, or play his last desperate card, defy the world
and maintain that he was indeed Tom Bob and no one else.
But would that suffice?</p>

<p><a id="png.317" href="#png.317"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>317<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Still, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> would have risked everything on this
last chance, had he not had an opponent as cunning as
himself, and now free to act. He knew, in fact, that from
one minute to the next he might find himself face to face
with <span lang="fr">Juve</span>—not <span lang="fr">Juve</span>, the ordinary adversary he had been
before, but <span lang="fr">Juve</span> proved innocent of the crimes he was
accused of, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> his character rehabilitated in all men’s
eyes, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> with power and authority fortified by the priceless,
invaluable collaboration of the whole police force of
France. After coldly weighing his chances of victory
against those of defeat, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> decided for flight.</p>

<p>Still the hardy scoundrel did not go at once. Examining
the room where he was, he noted a safe embedded in the
wall. An evil smile crossed his pallid lips; cynically he
muttered:</p>

<p>“So the Grand Duchess Alexandra has constituted herself
treasurer of the fund for the good souls who were for
subscribing <span lang="fr">Fantômas’</span> million! <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>,” he went on
with a vile grin, “would be a simpleton indeed not to pay
to himself what is meant for him.”</p>

<p>Evidently the ruffian knew the secret of the strongbox.
Was it not he, in fact, who had advised Lady Beltham to
purchase it? <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> opened the safe, drew out its
contents in handfuls, stuffed his pockets full of gold and
notes.</p>

<p>For a moment he was disturbed in this twice infamous
robbery by the creak of an opening door; he looked round,
startled and confused, but he could see nothing, the door
had been reclosed. And <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, never knowing that his
last act of brigandage had so profoundly shocked his mistress
that she had fallen fainting to the floor in the next
room, went on with his thievery.</p>

<p>With infinite precautions, five minutes afterward, the
thief was creeping surreptitiously down the back stairs;
gaining the deserted offices, he found an open window, and
leapt into the garden behind the house. He had his good
reasons for not leaving by the front gates. Cowardly, like
a traitor, like a wild beast pursued by the hunters, like
a criminal hiding after a dastardly deed, he glided into the
deep shade of the pleached alley, muffling his footsteps,
revolver in hand, ready to resist the first attack, confident
of escaping the most ingeniously laid trap.</p>

<p><a id="png.318" href="#png.318"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>318<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Then he halted for a second. The hot sun of this summer
afternoon pierced the heavy overhanging foliage and
threw on the ground a hundred black, dancing shadows
that patterned the mossy carpet and dazzled the eyes.
But the robber’s keen ear had caught a suspicious sound
and he stopped to listen. Was someone spying on him?
Instinctively he told himself:</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Juve</span>, since yesterday a free man, and by a miracle
escaped from the hands of my confederates, is perhaps at
my heels?”</p>

<p>Then came a cry of rage! Suddenly, emerging from the
bushes, a man had sprung at his throat. The man was
<span lang="fr">Juve</span>!</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> fired, without a tremble of the outstretched
arm, at point blank range. But the ball never reached
its aim; piercing the thick roof of greenery above, it lost
itself in the sky. For at the same instant he had caught
sight of <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and taken aim at his heart, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> was
attacked in the rear. A formidable blow across the loins
upset his balance and the villain measured his length on
the ground. Boiling with rage, he pressed the trigger and
shot off at random the four remaining charges—quite without
effect. The bullets struck no one; ploughing up the
soil, they raised a thick cloud of dust, and that was all.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Juve</span> had leapt upon his assailant instantly; kneeling
on the man’s chest, he held him down, both hands gripping
his throat. Looking up, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> could see his face, and
<span lang="fr">Fandor’s</span> beside it. He was done for! his two implacable
enemies had him in their power.</p>

<p>Hours ago officer and journalist had planned his arrest.
Instead of hurrying off to find <span lang="fr">M. Havard</span>, as the latter
hoped, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> had sworn to themselves to set
off at once, hot foot, on the track of the atrocious villain.
They had been well advised in going straight to Lady
Beltham’s, for no sooner did they reach the neighbourhood
of the house in the <span lang="fr">Parc des Princes</span> than they saw <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>
slip in. Thereupon, making sure the outlaw would
inevitably try to escape by way of the hidden pathway
behind the building, they ensconced themselves in the
deepest shadow of the trees and waited.</p>

<p>Their foresight was rewarded; they had the brigand
hard and fast. In one second, with amazing dexterity,
<a id="png.319" href="#png.319"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>319<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><span lang="fr">Juve</span> had his prisoner handcuffed. With his hands thus
linked together in front of him, <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> was harmless,
helpless, impotent. With a vigorous push <span lang="fr">Juve</span> forced him
to his knees, then to his feet. Gripping their captive by
the arms, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> on one side, <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> on the other, the two,
without a word—they might surely have found too much to
say, and thought it best to hold their tongue—dragged off
their redoubtable prisoner towards the door at the far end
of the park.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> was deep in thought:</p>

<p>“Once they get me as far as there, once they drag me
over the threshold of that door, once I leave this garden,
it is all up, I am done for!”</p>

<p>With amazing coolness the extraordinary man analysed
the situation, and in two seconds drew his conclusion. He
had a hundred yards still to go along the tree-shaded pathway;
before that hundred yards was traversed, he must
find a means of escape—or <span class="prellips">else </span><span class="ellips">...</span><!-- TN: original has period followed by ellipsis; original has superfluous closing double quote --></p>

<p>Any display of physical force was impossible! any exertion
of strength would have been in vain; <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>
held him fast, each with a grip of steel, their strength
doubled by the furious anger that tightened their muscles
and the triumph that swelled their hearts to have captured
the scoundrel. Nor could <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> dream of eluding their
vigilance or asking any favour of his captors; the pitiless
ruffian could hope for no pity!</p>

<p>The last fifty yards only remained, and <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> had
devised nothing yet.</p>

<p>But suddenly a gleam of ferocity flashed in his eye.
With a sudden spring, he threw himself to one side of
the pathway, shouldering back <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> who was on his left,
dragging <span lang="fr">Juve</span> on his right after him. Next moment, with
a lightning dart neither officer nor journalist could anticipate,
the brigand had fallen on two hives and kicked them
over.</p>

<p>True, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span>, instantly hauled him back to
the middle of the path, but yells of agony now burst from
their lips. The bees, disturbed in their peaceful labours,
exasperated at the earthquake that had befallen them, rose
in angry swarms and swooped down on the three men!
Burning for revenge, the insects in their hurrying thousands
fell upon their enemies!</p>

<p><a id="png.320" href="#png.320"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>320<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>With the hand left free—for they would not loose hold
of <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>—<span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> strove instinctively to parry
the attack, to sweep away the clustering swarms. But this
made things worse; the number of the aggressors was
only multiplied. Now about their faces whirled a buzzing,
eddying cloud of infuriated creatures!</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, on the contrary, who had had a second or
two’s time to think what course was best to adopt after
upsetting the hives, forced himself to stand absolutely still,
refraining from making the slightest movement, barely stirring
lips and eyelids. And the bees, in their blindness,
never attacking the villain who was their real enemy,
directed all their efforts to the two who, from the weird
gesticulations they indulged in, seemed the most redoubtable
foes.</p>

<p>Stung in a thousand places, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> shrieked in
agony and, overmastered by the pain, let go their prisoner.</p>

<p>The latter, following the same tactics, dropped to the
ground, burying his face in the grass by the side of the
pathway. There <span lang="fr">Fantômas</span> lay as still as death, while <span lang="fr">Juve</span>
and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> fell victims to the angry bees, all the more
because they waved their arms wildly about and tried to
defend themselves.</p>

<p>Beaten at last, the two martyrs abandoned all efforts to
resist and rolled on the ground in transports of insufferable
pain!</p>

<p class="thtbk"><br class="ns">Two hours after, <span lang="fr">Juve</span> and <span lang="fr">Fandor</span> were discovered lying
under the trees in the garden of the grand duchess’s house;
they were unconscious, half dead, their faces so disfigured
by the bees’ merciless stings as to be unrecognizable.</p>

<p>As for Tom Bob-<span lang="fr">Fantômas</span>, <em>he</em> had disappeared. Once
again that monster of iniquity was at large<span class="ellips">....</span></p>

<p>Would he add yet more atrocities to the long list of his
crimes???</p>
